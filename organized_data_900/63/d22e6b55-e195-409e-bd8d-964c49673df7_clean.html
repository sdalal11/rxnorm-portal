A UCDHS interpreter was not used during this encounter.<br/> <br/>As you know, this is a [REDACTED] R-handed female with a past medical history of MDD, anxiety on alprazolam, lumbar spine disease with distal foot numbness , breast cancer,  who established care with me on [REDACTED] for evaluation of concern for possible LBD. <br/><br/>In brief she described 2 years of issues with falls, 1 year of tremor with handwriting, some stiffness in the arms, some slowing down but still independent in ADLs, 1 year of softening of the voice, and some nonn-motor issues with short term memory loss with a MOCA 20/30 on 06/2023,  with deficits visuospatial, language, delayed recall and was given Dx of MCI with some concern regarding possible lewy body dementia. She describes that she started noticing some changes a couple of years ago but over time she has developed issues with reading comprehension ( used to read a lot). She did endorse a history of hallucinations which she believed to be related to changes being made in her psych meds at the time.  She had has a history of depression and anxiety including panic attacks and had been on Abilify for approximately 1 year which have been discontinued a few months before establishing with me but she was later put back on it for her mood.  She did endorse dream enactment behavior including episode of having grabbed her husband in her sleep, some postural lightheadedness, 2-3 years of constipation.  She had been started on carbidopa/levodopa before establishing with me and was taking 1 tablet 3 times to 4 times daily, on 4 times daily she had had hallucinations, she had previously been tried on pramipexole.  She did feel that the medication was helping with her tremor<br/><br/>Interval History: <br/>She had neuropsych testing completed, she scored an 18/30 on the Moca during the encounter, she exhibited a prominent frontal subcortical cognitive profile with impaired processing speed, some executive dysfunction and visual spatial abilities that were mildly reduced, she also exhibited reduced speeded word retrieval, and some memory issues raising some concern for an early amnestic process, she also endorsed mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety.  Still able to perform most of her IADLs so at this time they felt her presentation was most consistent with mild cognitive impairment suggestive of an underlying neurodegenerative process most likely related to alpha synuclein neuropathy but there was concern for concomitant amnestic process. They recommended that she need to limit her driving to nearby and familiar places and that she should have a behind the wheel driving assessment before she renew her license. <br/><br/>She reports that since her last appointment she has been started on Donepazil 5mg and she had her Duloxetine dose. She is feeling a little better since this change.  <br/><br/>She did have an incident where she backed into her husband cars when he parked it an unusual spot, she only drives close to home and does not go on the highway. <br/><br/>Medication Regimen<br/>Carbidopa/levodopa  10/100mg 1 tablet 4 times a day Am, 1pm, 5-6pm, and bedtime  ( she has only been taking it 3 times a day instead, unclear why) <br/><br/>[REDACTED]<br/><br/>Medication list, past medical, surgical, family and social history were reviewed and/or documented in the electronic medical record. <br/><br/>Medications: <br/><br/>Current Outpatient Medications: <br/>  Alprazolam ([REDACTED]) 0.25 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily if needed.

Multiple nonspecific foci of abnormal T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensity<br/>are seen scattered throughout the subcortical and deep periventricular<br/>white matter, likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.<br/>2. A 1.0 cm retention cyst along the floor of the right maxillary<br/>sinus. <br/>3. Otherwise; unremarkable noncontrast MR evaluation of the brain/head.<br/><br/>Labs: B12 323, folate 9.7, TSH 1,27, thiamina 133, HIV non-reactive, syphilis non-reactive <br/><br/>Impression &amp; Plan:<br/>Parkinsonism<br/>Mild Cognitive Impairment<br/>REM sleep behavior disorder <br/>&gt; History of progressive loss of balance with some falls, memory changes, tremors for at least 2 year Exam with left sided predominant bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity and postural instability, additionally she has cognitive changes with MOCA 20/30 with outside provider and noticed to have some difficulty with more complex commands and losing track of the conversation during our appointment. Notably anxiety and depression have been a  major issue for her which she has been on Abilify for, she was off for a while but it was restarted recently so differential includes, [REDACTED] disease with early cognitive changes, dementia with Lewy body, other dementia syndrome with drug induced [REDACTED] is another consideration, though history of abnormal DaT scan and constipation and some dream enactment suppory an alpha-synucleinopathy. Her MRI brain does show some moderate microvascular disease and some atrophy.  On her neuropsych testing she meets criteria for mild cognitive impairment with a frontal subcortical cognitive profile with reduced processing speed, executive dysfunction, and some abnormal visual spatial abilities that are considered to be mildly reduced, she also had word retrieval difficulties and memory difficulties concerning for a some amnestic quality, felt to be likely neurodegenerative in nature with a presumed alpha synuclein neuropathy, however with some amnestic quality which would raise concern for concomitant Alzheimer's process as well.  She has been started on donepezil and has also had her depression medications adjusted and she was feeling a little better with that change.<br/>&gt; Medication Plan<br/>- she was had a little worsening in her [REDACTED] scale, we discussed an increase in medication but actually determined she had self decreased down to t.i.d. so she will increase back to her prior q.i.d. Dosing 1st<br/>&gt; she requested that I send a copy of [REDACTED] notes<br/>&gt; to her psychiatrist she was now donepezil 5 mg, while being on Abilify and increase dose Cymbalta being managed by Psychiatry at this time, if she is tolerating then can further titrate donepezil over time but will require some QTC monitoring<br/>&gt; based on neuropsych testing it was recommended that she needs to limit her driving to familiar areas during daylight hours, and they also recommended that she should have an on road driving assessment before renewing her driver's license which she was due for in [REDACTED], I explained that the areas in which they found deficits on her cognitive testing can pose a safety risk for driving and that I am going to recommend she have an in-person driving assessment and will complete the DMV request for that to happen<br/>&gt; for her next appointment I would like her to come to the [REDACTED] multidisciplinary clinic<br/> <br/><br/>Return to clinic [REDACTED].<br/><br/>Total time I spent in care of this patient [REDACTED] (excluding time spent on other billable services) was 50 minutes. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>[REDACTED], DO <br/>Assistant Clinical Professor <br/>Department of Neurology<br/>[REDACTED][REDACTED]<br/><br/></content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by [REDACTED], DO at [REDACTED]  2:23 PM PDT</span><br/></content></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id7" href="#toc">Nursing Notes</a></h3><div><ul><li>[REDACTED], MA - [REDACTED] 10:40 AM PDT: <content><content><span class="xLabel">Formatting of this note might be different from the original.</span><br/>Patient ID confirmed using 2 identifiers.<br/>Vital signs taken, allergies verified, screened for pain, and med history taken. <br/><br/>[REDACTED], [REDACTED]</content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by [REDACTED], MA at [REDACTED] 10:41 AM PDT</span><br/></content></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id8" href="#toc">Plan of Treatment</a></h3><div><table><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Upcoming Encounters</span><colgroup><col width="10%"/><col width="15%"/><col width="25%" span="3"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Type</th><th>Department</th><th>Care Team (Latest Contact Info)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="encounter34" class="xRowNormal"><td>[REDACTED] 11:30 AM PDT</td><td ID="encounter34type">Office Visit</td><td><p>Midtown Neurology</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]-5266</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>Office Manager: [REDACTED]</p></td><td><p>[REDACTED], DO</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>Suite 2100</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id9" href="#toc">Visit Diagnoses</a></h3><div><table><colgroup><col width="100%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="vdx5" class="xRowNormal"><td><p><span class="content_span">Parkinsonism, unspecified Parkinsonism type (HCC)</span><span class="content_span"> - Primary</span></p></td></tr><tr ID="vdx6" class="xRowAlt"><td><p><span class="content_span">Mild cognitive impairment</span></p><p>Mild cognitive impairment, so stated</p></td></tr></tbody></table>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id10" href="#toc">Care Teams</a></h3><div><table ID="ct45"><colgroup><col width="25%" span="3"/><col width="13%"/><col width="12%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Team Member</th><th>Relationship</th><th>Specialty</th><th>Start Date</th><th>End Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td><p>[REDACTED], [REDACTED], MD</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>Internal Medicine</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td>PCP - General</td><td>INTERNAL MEDICINE</td><td>[REDACTED]</td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><br/><br/>
