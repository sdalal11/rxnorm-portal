He was first evaluated by [REDACTED], MD, on [REDACTED]. He was last seen at this clinic by this provider on [REDACTED], who recommended the following:  <br/><br/>1) For further cognitive/memory support, INCREASE rivastigmine (Exelon) to 13.3 mg/24 hr patch as instructed, apply 1 patch once daily, rotate sites daily.<br/>- In the meantime, okay to apply 9.5 mg patch alternating with 13.3 mg patch every other day until you run out of the lower dose. After that, follow instructions as above. <br/>[Done]<br/><br/>2) Follow-up visit [REDACTED].     <br/>- In the meantime, call ([REDACTED]) or send a MyChart message as needed for any questions/concerns/new changes prior to next visit. <br/>[Done]<br/><br/>---<br/>- History was obtained from both patient and his wife.  <br/>- Since the last visit:<br/>- Cognitive function has been slightly worse, short-term memory is main issue ("his short-term memory is gone," per wife).   <br/>- Behavioral changes were noted or reported: "feels miserable when in pain" (suffering from low back and bilat hip pain, followed by ortho). <br/>- Physical changes were noted or reported: tremor to hands, worse per wife, intermittent, occurs to both side (primarily when at rest, such as sitting down and watching TV), non-disabling per wife. Weight more stable. Some redness and itching to site where patch is. <br/>---<br/><br/>Currently taking the following medications related to presenting symptoms:<br/>- rivastigmine (Exelon) 13.3 mg patch/24 hrs: Apply 1 patch once daily. Rotate sites daily. Remove old patch prior to applying a new one. <br/><br/>Has tried the following medications related to presenting symptoms: <br/>- sertraline (Zoloft): was started while inpatient early 2021, wife had asked to d/c medication as he wasn't depressed/anxious and developed tremor to hands (resolved after med was d/c'd) per wife's report [REDACTED].<br/>- donepezil (Aricept) Take 15 mg (1.5 tablets of 10 mg tablet) by mouth once nightly at bedtime. Switched to rivastigmine TD due to weight loss/reduced appetite. <br/><br/>PAST MEDICAL HISTORY <br/>Diagnosis Date <br/> Hypertension  <br/> Memory changes  <br/> Poliomyelitis osteopathy of right ankle and foot (HCC)  <br/>* aortic heart valve replacement (7/2016) and right knee replacement (11/2016) <br/><br/>Current Outpatient Medications <br/>Medication Sig <br/> aspirin, enteric coated (ASPIRIN, ENTERIC COATED) 81 mg EC tablet Take 81 mg by mouth once daily. <br/> omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule  <br/> Ibandronate 150 mg tablet Take 150 mg by mouth. <br/> rivastigmine (EXELON PATCH) 13.3 mg/24 hour patch Apply 1 Patch as directed once daily. <br/> cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, (VITAMIN D3 ORAL) Take by mouth. <br/> ubidecarenone (CO Q-10 ORAL) Take by mouth. <br/> CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCIUM 500 ORAL) Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily. <br/> atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet Take 10 mg by mouth every other day. <br/> <br/> METOPROLOL SUCCINATE ORAL Take 25 mg by mouth once daily. <br/> CYANOCOBALAMIN, VITAMIN B-12, (VITAMIN B-12 ORAL) Take 1 tablet by mouth once daily. <br/> Multivitamin capsule Take 1 capsule by mouth once daily. <br/> GLUC/CHND/OM3/DHA/EPA/FISH/STR (GLUCOSAMINE CHONDROITIN PLUS ORAL) Take 1 tablet by mouth twice daily. <br/><br/>No current facility-administered medications for this visit. <br/><br/>ROS:<br/>- Appetite-fluctuates <br/>- Activity-still undergoing PT 3 days/week   <br/>- ADLs-self-sufficient with bADLs; wife monitoring all iADLs <br/>- Memory-fair<br/>- Hallucinations- patient denies, none noted<br/>- Sleep-ok, no issues; denied any enactment of dreams/vocalization <br/>- Falls-none recently; ambulates with [REDACTED], also has a cane <br/>- Driving-yes, though very limited if so (just going to PT and home), no nighttime driving; denied any hx of MVA/traffic citations since last visit; have gotten turned around when in an unfamiliar environment  <br/><br/>GENERAL MEDICAL / NEUROLOGICAL EXAM<br/>BP 145/74 (BP Site: Right Arm, BP Position: Sitting, BP Cuff Size: Regular Adult)  | Pulse 69  | Ht 177.8 cm (5' 10")  | Wt 90.6 kg (199 lb 12.8 oz)  | BMI 28.67 kg/m² <br/>Vitals [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] <br/>WEIGHT in POUNDS 175 lb 191 lb 9.6 oz 195 lb 199 lb 12.8 oz <br/>General: NAD.

He demonstrated a slight decline in learning of verbal information and in recognition of unstructured verbal information (word list). Verbal delayed recall was Mildly Impaired and consistent with previous testing, whereas nonverbal delayed recall was actually improved and within normal limits. He also demonstrated Mildly Impaired object naming performance, which is a decline from his previous testing. His performance in other domains was generally similar to his testing in [REDACTED]. Although he and his wife reported some difficulties with navigating while driving and feeling disoriented in unfamiliar areas, he has not gotten lost or had any accidents. His wife also reported that he may have inadvertently signed up for additional car insurance (possible scam), but the situation is unclear. They otherwise reported that he is independent in activities of daily living. Regarding emotional functioning, he endorsed mild symptoms of depression and moderate symptoms of anxiety, and his wife endorsed issues related to irritability. <br/> <br/>Although [REDACTED] demonstrated some mild declines on testing, he maintains several cognitive strengths, and he and his wife continue to support that he is independent in activities of daily living, which is consistent with a mild neurocognitive disorder. It should be noted that he may be on the cusp of an early dementia diagnosis and that he should be followed closely. Given his declines in memory and naming in conjunction with his MRI findings of hippocampal atrophy and moderate white matter ischemia, the etiology of his deficits is likely a mixed vascular and Alzheimer’s disease process." <br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Assessment: <br/>The patient is felt to have cognitive impairment likely due to Alzheimer + cerebrovascular disease. <br/>- FAST: ~mild <br/><br/>PLAN:<br/>1) We discussed the following:<br/>- Continue medications as is at this time. Advised trial of otc topical hydrocortisone for mild skin irritation/itch.  <br/>- Re: hand tremor -- after some discussion we will continue to monitor. We discussed obtaining a DaTScan; though d/t several medical appts b/t him and his wife, they prefer to hold off at this time as symptom not bothersome/non-disabling. Discussed should they change their minds, they can call our center prior to next visit or can simply revisit at next appt.  <br/><br/>2) Follow-up visit [REDACTED].     <br/><br/>See AVS.<br/><br/>Patient/patient's caregiver verbalized understanding of treatment plan.  <br/><br/>I spent a total of 50 minutes on the date of the service which included preparing to see the patient, patient care, completing clinical documentation, obtaining and/or reviewing separately obtained history, performing a medically appropriate examination, counseling and educating the patient/family/caregiver, and ordering medications, tests, or procedures. <br/>---<br/>[REDACTED], PhD, MSN, APRN, FNP-BC <br/>Cognitive Disorders Clinic<br/>[REDACTED] [REDACTED] <br/>[REDACTED] Center for Brain Health <br/>[REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED]<br/>Office: [REDACTED]<br/>Fax: [REDACTED]<br/></content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by [REDACTED] [REDACTED], APRN.CNP at [REDACTED]  9:55 PM EDT</span><br/></content></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id8" href="#toc">Plan of Treatment</a></h3><div><table><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Upcoming Encounters</span><colgroup><col width="10%"/><col width="15%"/><col width="25%" span="3"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Type</th><th>Department</th><th>Care Team (Latest Contact Info)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="encounter37" class="xRowNormal"><td>[REDACTED]  9:15 AM PDT</td><td ID="encounter37type">Office Visit</td><td><p>Neurology</p><p>[REDACTED][REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p></td><td><p>[REDACTED], APRN.CNP</p><p>[REDACTED][REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td><span class="content_span">Return in about 4 months (around [REDACTED]).</span></td></tr><tr ID="encounter36" class="xRowAlt"><td>[REDACTED]  8:30 AM PDT</td><td ID="encounter36type">Office Visit</td><td><p>Neurology</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p></td><td><p>[REDACTED], APRN.CNP, PhD</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td><span class="content_span">Return in about 6 months (around [REDACTED]).</span></td></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id9" href="#toc">Visit Diagnoses</a></h3><div><table><colgroup><col width="100%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="vdx5" class="xRowNormal"><td><p><span class="content_span">Memory loss</span><span class="content_span"> - Primary</span></p></td></tr><tr ID="vdx6" class="xRowAlt"><td><p><span class="content_span">Vascular disease</span></p><p>Unspecified circulatory system disorder</p></td></tr><tr ID="vdx7" class="xRowNormal"><td><p><span class="content_span">Alzheimer's disease (HCC)</span></p><p>Alzheimer's disease</p></td></tr></tbody></table>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id10" href="#toc">Care Teams</a></h3><div><table ID="ct48"><colgroup><col width="25%" span="3"/><col width="13%"/><col width="12%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Team Member</th><th>Relationship</th><th>Specialty</th><th>Start Date</th><th>End Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td><p>[REDACTED], MD</p><p>NPI: [REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>Suite 407</p><p>[REDACTED], NV 89052</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td>PCP - General</td><td>Internal Medicine</td><td>[REDACTED]</td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><br/><br/>
