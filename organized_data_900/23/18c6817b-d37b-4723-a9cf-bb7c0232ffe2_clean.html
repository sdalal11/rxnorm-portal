Patient reports to have previously had back surgery to L4 and L5, increased risk for post op complications. <br/><br/>Vital Signs: BP, RR, HR, SpO2, and temperature were reviewed and interpreted by myself.<br/>Comments: BP 150/89.

Per extensively reviewing the patient's medical records, there are no pertinent records for this visit. <br/><br/>Independent Historian (other): Patient and his wife was independently interviewed. This patient required confirmatory/additional information that I have judged to be pertinent to this patient's current complaint and medically necessary for complete treatment of the patient. The patient is unable to provide the information obtained from this independent historian and I have deemed this information to be necessary for a complete history. Information from independent source required due to patient's wife at bedside offered additional history.<br/><br/>External Records: No external records to review. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Imaging/Radiology: Reference ED Course for my interpretation of image findings.

Thin axial CT images and multiplanar reformations were reconstructed.<br/><br/>Technical factors are evaluated and adjusted to ensure appropriate radiation exposure and maintain diagnostic image quality.  Automated exposure control is used to adjust the radiation dose to minimize exposure.  When available, iterative reconstruction techniques are used to lower radiation dose.<br/><br/>FINDINGS: There is maintenance of the normal lumbar arthrosis.<br/><br/>There is no acute fracture or acute malalignment.<br/><br/>There is metallic internal fixation with transpedicular screws at the L4 and L5 levels with the hardware in grossly good position. Interbody spacer at the L4-L5 disc level in good position with incomplete osseous fusion.<br/><br/>There is a small sclerotic focus anteriorly in the T11 vertebral body measuring 6.9 mm likely a benign bone island.<br/><br/>There is a congenitally narrowed central spinal canal. Along with degenerative changes there is at least moderate central canal stenosis at L3-L4. Foraminal stenosis at multiple levels without direct compression of the exiting nerve roots.<br/><br/>Surrounding soft tissues show no acute changes.There is diffuse atherosclerotic changes of the abdominal aorta without significant focal aneurysm.<br/> <br/><br/>Cardio Procedures Ordered - No data to display<br/>Respiratory Orders - No data to display<br/> <br/>ED Course/Interventions:<br/>ED Course as of [REDACTED] 1926 <br/>[REDACTED] <br/>1751 This is a [REDACTED]. male who presents to the ED for evaluation of back pain after MVC. Upon exam, the patient showed mild diffused tenderness to L4 and L5 at site of previous surgery, 5/5 strength to bilateral lower extremities, abdomen soft, non distended or tender. I will evaluate for the differential diagnoses as mentioned above. <br/> [EL] <br/>1914 CT LUMBAR SPINE W/O CONTRAST (TRAUMA)<br/> No acute abnormality.
