The two ligaments inside the knee protect this joint from excess forward and backward movement. The ligaments on the outside of the joint prevent side-to-side motion. These are called the collateral ligaments.<br/>The medial collateral ligament is located on the inner side of the joint; and the lateral collateral ligament is on the outer side of the joint.<br/>A sprain is a tearing of a ligament. The tear may be partial or complete. Diagnosis is made by physical exam. In the case of an acute injury, the knee may be too swollen or painful to examine fully. A more accurate exam can be done after the initial swelling goes down.<br/>Symptoms of a knee sprain include immediate knee swelling, pain, and difficulty walking. Initial treatment includes rest, splinting the knee to reduce movement of the joint, and icing the knee to reduce swelling and pain. You may use over-the-counter pain medicine to control pain, unless another medicine was prescribed. Most sprains will heal in 3 to 6 weeks. A severe injury can take 3 to 4 months to heal. You may also need rehab exercises. Surgery is usually not required for sprains involving only the collateral ligaments.<br/>Home care<br/>· Stay off the injured leg as much as possible until you can walk on it without pain. If you have a lot of pain while walking, crutches or a walker may be prescribed. These can be rented or purchased at many pharmacies and surgical or orthopedic supply stores. Follow your healthcare provider’s advice about when to begin bearing weight on that leg. <br/>· If you were given a hook-and-loop closure knee brace, you can remove it to bathe. But leave it in place when walking, sitting, or lying down unless told otherwise.<br/>· Apply an ice pack over the injured area for 15 to 20 minutes every 3 to 6 hours. You should do this for the first 24 to 48 hours. You can make an ice pack by filling a plastic bag that seals at the top with ice cubes and then wrapping it with a thin towel. Continue to use ice packs for relief of pain and swelling as needed. As the ice melts, be careful to avoid getting your wrap, splint, or cast wet. You can place the ice pack directly over the splint. If you have to wear a hook-and-loop knee brace, you can open it to apply the ice pack, or heat, directly to the knee. Never put ice directly on the skin. Always wrap the ice in a towel or other type of cloth.<br/>· You may use over-the-counter pain medicine to control pain, unless another pain medicine was prescribed. Anti-inflammatory pain medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen may be more effective than acetaminophen. If you have chronic liver or kidney disease or ever had a stomach ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, talk with your healthcare provider before using these medicines.<br/>Follow-up care<br/>Follow up with your healthcare provider as advised. Any X-rays you had today don’t show any broken bones, breaks, or fractures. Sometimes fractures don’t show up on the first X-ray. Bruises and sprains can sometimes hurt as much as a fracture. These injuries can take time to heal completely. If your symptoms don’t improve or they get worse, talk with your healthcare provider. You may need a repeat X-ray or other tests such as MRI. If X-rays were taken, you will be told of any new findings that may affect your care.<br/>Call 911<br/>Call 911 if you have:<br/>·  Shortness of breath<br/>·  Chest pain<br/>When to seek medical advice<br/>Call your healthcare provider right away if any of these occur:<br/>· Pain or swelling increases<br/>· Swelling, redness, or pain in the calf or thigh<br/>StayWell last reviewed this educational content on 5/1/2018<br/><br/>© 2000-2021 The StayWell Company, LLC.

Always follow your healthcare professional's instructions.<br/><br/>Knee Pain<br/>Knee pain is very common. It’s especially common in active people who put a lot of pressure on their knees, like runners. It affects women more often than men.<br/>Your kneecap (patella) is a thick, round bone. It covers and protects the front portion of your knee joint. It moves along a groove in your thighbone (femur) as part of the patellofemoral joint. A layer of cartilage surrounds the underside of your kneecap. This layer protects it from grinding against your femur.<br/>When this cartilage softens and breaks down, it can cause knee pain. This is partly because of repetitive stress. The stress irritates the lining of the joint. This causes pain in the underlying bone.<br/>What causes knee pain?<br/>Many things can cause knee pain. You may have more than one cause. Some of these include:<br/>· Overuse of the knee joint<br/>· The kneecap doesn’t line up with the tissue around it<br/>· Damage to small nerves in the area<br/>· Damage to the ligament-like structure that holds the kneecap in place (retinaculum)<br/>· Breakdown of the bone under the cartilage<br/>· Swelling in the soft tissues around the kneecap<br/>· Injury<br/>You might be more likely to have knee pain if you:<br/>· Exercise a lot<br/>· Recently increased the intensity of your workouts<br/>· Have a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25<br/>· Have poor alignment of your kneecap<br/>· Walk with your feet turned overly outward or inward<br/>· Have weakness in surrounding muscle groups (inner quad or hip adductor muscles)<br/>· Have too much tightness in surrounding muscle groups (hamstrings or iliotibial band)<br/>· Have a recent history of injury to the area<br/>· Are female<br/>Symptoms of knee pain<br/>This type of knee pain is a dull, aching pain in the front of the knee in the area under and around the kneecap. This pain may start quickly or slowly. Your pain might be worse when you squat, run, or sit for a long time. Climbing stairs may be painful or hard to do. You might also sometimes feel like your knee is giving out. You may have symptoms in one or both of your knees.<br/>Diagnosing knee pain<br/>Your healthcare provider will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. Be sure to describe any activities that make your knee pain worse. He or she will look at your knee. This will include tests of your range of motion, strength, and areas of pain of your knee. Your knee alignment will be checked.<br/>Your healthcare provider will need to rule out other causes of your knee pain, such as arthritis. You may need an imaging test, such as an X-ray or MRI.<br/>Treatment for knee pain<br/>Treatments that can help ease your symptoms may include:<br/>· Avoiding activities for a while that make your pain worse, returning to activity over time<br/>· Icing the outside of your knee when it causes you pain<br/>· Taking over-the-counter pain medicine such as NSAIDs<br/>· Wearing a knee brace or taping your knee to support it<br/>· Compression to help prevent swelling<br/>· Wearing special shoe inserts to help keep your feet in the proper alignment<br/>· Elevating your knee<br/>· Doing special exercises to stretch and strengthen the muscles around your hip and your knee<br/>These steps help most people manage knee pain. But some cases of knee pain need to be treated with surgery. You rarely need surgery right away. You may need it later if other treatments don’t work. Your healthcare provider may refer you to an orthopedic surgeon. He or she will talk with you about your choices.<br/>Preventing knee pain<br/>Losing weight and correcting excess muscle tightness or muscle weakness may help lower your risk.<br/>In some cases, you can prevent knee pain. To help prevent a flare-up of knee pain, do these things:<br/>· Regularly do all the exercises your doctor or physical therapist advises<br/>· Warm up fully before exercising<br/>· Support your knee as advised by your doctor or physical therapist<br/>· Increase training gradually, and ease up on training when needed<br/>· Have an expert check your gait for running or other sporting activities<br/>· Stretch properly before and after exercise<br/>· Replace your running shoes regularly<br/>· Lose excess weight<br/>When to call your healthcare provider<br/>Call your healthcare provider right away if:<br/>· Your symptoms don’t get better after a few weeks of treatment<br/>· You have any new symptoms<br/>StayWell last reviewed this educational content on 6/1/2019<br/><br/>© 2000-2021 The StayWell Company, LLC.

Always follow your healthcare professional's instructions.<br/><br/>RICE<br/> <br/>Rest an injury, elevate it, and use ice and compression as directed. <br/><br/>RICE stands for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. These can limit pain and swelling after an injury. RICE may be recommended to help treat breaks (fractures), sprains, strains, and bruises or bumps. <br/>Home care<br/>Here are the details of RICE:<br/>· Rest. Limit the use of the injured body part. This helps prevent further damage to the body part and gives it time to heal. In some cases, you may need a sling, brace, splint, or cast to help keep the body part still until it has healed.<br/>· Ice. Applying ice right after an injury helps relieve pain and swelling. To make an ice pack, put ice cubes in a plastic bag that seals at the top. Wrap the bag in a clean, thin towel or cloth. Then place it over the injured area. Do this for 10 to 15 minutes every 3 to 4 hours. Continue for the next 1 to 3 days or until your symptoms improve. Never put ice directly on your skin. Don't ice an area longer than 15 minutes at a time.<br/>· Compression. Putting pressure on an injury helps reduce swelling and provides support. Wrap the injured area firmly with an elastic bandage or wrap. Make sure not to wrap the bandage too tightly or you will cut off blood flow to the injured area. If your bandage loosens, rewrap it.<br/>· Elevation. Keeping an injury raised or elevated above the level of your heart reduces swelling, pain, and throbbing. For instance, if you have a broken leg, it may help to rest your leg on several pillows when sitting or lying down. Try to keep the injured area elevated as often as possible.<br/>Follow-up care<br/>Follow up with your healthcare provider, or as advised.<br/>When to seek medical advice<br/>Call your healthcare provider right away if any of these occur:<br/>· Fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, or as directed by your healthcare provider<br/>· Chills<br/>· Increased pain or swelling in the injured body part<br/>· Injured body part becomes cold, blue, numb, or tingly<br/>· Signs of infection. These include warmth in the skin, redness, drainage, or bad smell coming from the injured body part.<br/>StayWell last reviewed this educational content on 6/1/2018<br/><br/>© 2000-2021 The StayWell Company, LLC.

Always follow your healthcare professional's instructions.<br/><br/>Increasing Your Knee’s Range of Motion<br/>Swelling, tight muscles, or scar tissue may make it hard to move your knee. Work with your physical therapist to increase your knee’s range of motion. The following treatments and others may be used. <br/> <br/>Passive range-of-motion exercises help increase your knee’s mobility. <br/><br/>· Thermal ultrasound. Sound waves are used to create deep heat. This improves blood flow and can promote tissue healing.<br/>· Moving your kneecap (patella mobilization). This is done by your physical therapist. It prevents the buildup of scar tissue and improves range of motion.<br/>· Bracing or taping. This is often used to correct a problem with patellar tracking.<br/>· Passive range-of-motion exercises. These gently bend and straighten your knee joint. Your leg is moved by your physical therapist or a machine.<br/>· Assistive range-of-motion exercises. These also move your knee. You use your own strength. Your physical therapist or a machine will help you.<br/>· Active range-of-motion exercises. These are done by bending and straightening your knees under your own power.<br/>StayWell last reviewed this educational content on 8/1/2021<br/><br/>© 2000-2021 The StayWell Company, LLC.

Walking on the beach and fell backwards into sand pit, hyperextended R knee, and felt a pop. Pt denies swelling or bruising.  After standing her bearings for a few minutes, patient was able to weight-bear back to her hotel room.  She was requesting ice total, however there was none available to her also.  Instead patient elevated her right lower extremity on a few pillows and slept throughout the night.<br/><br/>3/17-patient was preparing to return to the United States.  However, when preparing to leave, she, couldn't clear her RLE into cab w/o manually lifting it up and into car.  These are new symptoms for the patient, or concerns.  Also, patient reports that her gait discrepancy is one that is antalgic, and most noticeable when she is in midstance/ wt bearing.  Pain is in the back of the knee and does not radiate.  Currently, pain is reported as 7 out of 10.  She reports that she can tolerate up to 10 out of 10 pain.  However she takes medications for chronic pain.  On her home meds she has hydrocodone-acetaminophen 7.5-325 mg every 4 hours as needed.  Patient self reports that she takes morphine extended release as well to 10 mg daily (this is not listed on record as home med).  When inquiring about her practices of her pain medication, she reports that she is not waiting till her pain is significantly high, she is resting on top of it even if she does not actively have aggressive/ acute pain. <br/><br/>She felt as if she could not walk the distance to her terminal/gate,  requiring a wheelchair.  Patient denies any challenges with her first flight, other than mild discomfort of the right lower extremity with the knee flexed in a dependent position.  Because patient missed her connecting flight to Mesquite, she decided to come in to the UofU hospital to "get checked out by the experts."<br/><br/>Pt denies any numbness/tingling, or swelling.

However, her physical exam does not support this type of pathology.  She is able to extend her knee.  Patient successfully assisted in flexing at the hip to actively lifting her leg off the bed to allow me to remove the pillow from under her knee.  There are no physical exam signs to indicate acute ligamentous pathology such as swelling, ecchymosis, erythema, however patient's habitus may hide effusion.  Due to her history of having a TKA, her body habitus, the nature of her traumatic episode, there is concern of possible hardware malalignment.  Also, discussed with patient may have had ligamentous sprain even though the stability is preserved. Standing b/l knee films, AP ordered to rule out hardware pathology.  Patient is not currently on blood thinners to warrant concern of possible hemarthrosis.  Her pain is well controlled at the moment, she is hemodynamically stable.  Ordered Oxy 5 to 10 mg p.o. as needed.<br/><br/>0345 update: X-ray imaging read significant for moderate right knee joint effusion without findings hardware complication or other acute fracture.<br/><br/>This finding supports the suspicion for possible ligamentous sprain, possibly MCL.  We discussed these findings with the patient, and explained how her current clinical presentation does not warrant further consultation with orthopedic surgery for any acute intervention or admission for hospitalization.  Also, we discussed how this can be managed in outpatient setting with close follow-up with orthopedics.  We will plan to discharge the patient with a hinged brace to assist with ambulation, encourage RICE, that her pain is adequately controlled with her current home regimen, and refer her to outpatient orthopedic surgery clinic.  Patient reports that she had her right TKA done with TOSH, an outside hospital.  However, the referral with our orthopedic surgery team will be placed in the list to patient discretion that she chooses to follow-up.  Patient is hemodynamically stable, neurovascular intact at the time conversation was had and agreeable with the plan.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Consult: No Consult<br/><br/>Pulse Ox: Interpretation:  Normal <br/><br/>Attending Attestation: Patient seen and examined with the resident.
