It is possible to use preventive measures to significantly decrease the likelihood of falls. There are many simple measures which can make your home safer and prevent falls.<br/>OUTDOORS<br/>· Repair cracks and edges of walkways and driveways.<br/>· Remove high doorway thresholds.<br/>· Trim shrubbery on the main path into your home.<br/>· Have good outside lighting.<br/>· Clear walkways of tools, rocks, debris, and clutter.<br/>· Check that handrails are not broken and are securely fastened. Both sides of steps should have handrails.<br/>· Have leaves, snow, and ice cleared regularly.<br/>· Use sand or salt on walkways during winter months.<br/>· In the garage, clean up grease or oil spills.<br/>BATHROOM<br/>· Install night lights.<br/>· Install grab bars by the toilet and in the tub and shower.<br/>· Use non-skid mats or decals in the tub or shower.<br/>· Place a plastic non-slip stool in the shower to sit on, if needed.<br/>· Keep floors dry and clean up all water on the floor immediately.<br/>· Remove soap buildup in the tub or shower on a regular basis.<br/>· Secure bath mats with non-slip, double-sided rug tape.<br/>· Remove throw rugs and tripping hazards from the floors.<br/>BEDROOMS<br/>· Install night lights.<br/>· Make sure a bedside light is easy to reach.<br/>· Do not use oversized bedding.<br/>· Keep a telephone by your bedside.<br/>· Have a firm chair with side arms to use for getting dressed.<br/>· Remove throw rugs and tripping hazards from the floor.<br/>KITCHEN<br/>· Keep handles on pots and pans turned toward the center of the stove. Use back burners when possible.<br/>· Clean up spills quickly and allow time for drying.<br/>· Avoid walking on wet floors.<br/>· Avoid hot utensils and knives.<br/>· Position shelves so they are not too high or low.<br/>· Place commonly used objects within easy reach.<br/>· If necessary, use a sturdy step stool with a grab bar when reaching.<br/>· Keep electrical cables out of the way.<br/>· Do not use floor polish or wax that makes floors slippery. If you must use wax, use non-skid floor wax.<br/>· Remove throw rugs and tripping hazards from the floor.<br/>STAIRWAYS<br/>· Never leave objects on stairs.<br/>· Place handrails on both sides of stairways and use them. Fix any loose handrails. Make sure handrails on both sides of the stairways are as long as the stairs.<br/>· Check carpeting to make sure it is firmly attached along stairs. Make repairs to worn or loose carpet promptly.<br/>· Avoid placing throw rugs at the top or bottom of stairways, or properly secure the rug with carpet tape to prevent slippage. Get rid of throw rugs, if possible.<br/>· Have an electrician put in a light switch at the top and bottom of the stairs.<br/>OTHER FALL PREVENTION TIPS<br/>· Wear low-heel or rubber-soled shoes that are supportive and fit well. Wear closed toe shoes.<br/>· When using a stepladder, make sure it is fully opened and both spreaders are firmly locked. Do not climb a closed stepladder.<br/>· Add color or contrast paint or tape to grab bars and handrails in your home. Place contrasting color strips on first and last steps.<br/>· Learn and use mobility aids as needed. Install an electrical emergency response system.<br/>· Turn on lights to avoid dark areas. Replace light bulbs that burn out immediately. Get light switches that glow.<br/>· Arrange furniture to create clear pathways. Keep furniture in the same place.<br/>· Firmly attach carpet with non-skid or double-sided tape.<br/>· Eliminate uneven floor surfaces.<br/>· Select a carpet pattern that does not visually hide the edge of steps.<br/>· Be aware of all pets.<br/>OTHER HOME SAFETY TIPS<br/>· Set the water temperature for 120° F (48.8° C).<br/>· Keep emergency numbers on or near the telephone.<br/>· Keep smoke detectors on every level of the home and near sleeping areas.<br/>Document Released: 12/08/2003 Document Revised: 06/18/2013 Document Reviewed: 03/08/2013<br/>ExitCare® Patient Information ©2015 ExitCare, LLC. This information is not intended to replace advice given to you by your health care provider. Make sure you discuss any questions you have with your health care provider.<br/><br/>Hydration: <br/><br/>You should stay well hydrated, drink at least 64 ounces (2 liters or 4 of the 16 oz bottles) of water daily and the more active you are the more you should drink. <br/><br/>Drink a 16oz bottle upon rising, another with breakfast, a third with lunch, and then the fourth with dinner. This is just an example of scheduling times to drink water, to help you remember. <br/><br/>It's a good idea to also drink electrolyte enhanced water and/or drink coconut water, which contains electrolytes naturally. Please read labels to avoid extra added sugar in some coconut water beverages. <br/><br/>Remember that there are also flavored waters if you are not happy with the plain taste. Simply go to the water section aisle of any grocery store and you will find a variety of water flavored with: lemon, lime, grape, strawberry, grapefruit,...  You can also add fruit of your choice to your own water at home.<br/><br/>SLEEP HYGIENE<br/><br/>The most common cause of insomnia is a change in your daily routine. For example,<br/>traveling, change in work hours, disruption of other behaviors (eating, exercise, leisure, stress, etc.), and relationship conflicts. Paying attention to good sleep hygiene is the most important thing you can do to maintain good sleep.<br/><br/>DO:<br/>Go to bed at the same time each day.<br/>Get up from bed at the same time each day.<br/>Get regular exercise each day, preferably in the morning. There is good evidence that regular exercise improves restful sleep. This includes stretching and aerobic exercise.<br/>Get regular exposure to outdoor or bright lights, especially in the late afternoon.<br/>Keep the temperature in your bedroom cool but comfortable.<br/>Keep the bedroom quiet when sleeping.<br/>Keep the bedroom dark enough to facilitate sleep.<br/>Use your bed only for sleep and sex.<br/>Take medications as directed. It is helpful to take prescribed sleeping pills one hour before bedtime, so you will be drowsy when you lie down. To avoid daytime drowsiness please allow at least ten hours between taking the medication and waking up. <br/>Spend the last hour before bed doing a calming activity such as reading, taking a warm bath, meditating, and/or aroma therapy. Activities should be conducted away from bright lights and not in bed.<br/>Avoid using electronics (laptop, TV, tablets) before bed or in the middle of the night. Light emanating from the screens is activating to the brain and can make it hard to fall asleep.<br/>Meditate and do deep breathing exercises<br/>Consider keeping a diary by your bed and write down everything that you're thinking - whether it's a grocery/to do list or what you couldn't do that day. Just write it all down.<br/>Try to empty your bladder before bedtime <br/><br/>DON’T:<br/>Exercise just before going to bed.<br/>Engage in stimulating activities just before bed that can cause excitement, stress, or anxiety. <br/>Have caffeine in the evening (i.e. coffee, tea, chocolate, sodas, etc.).<br/>Use alcohol to help you sleep. Alcohol may promote the onset of sleep, but it disrupts sleep as the body begins to metabolize the alcohol, causing arousal. <br/> Go to bed too full or too hungry.<br/>Take another person’s sleeping pills.<br/>Take over-the-counter sleeping pills, without your provider’s knowledge. Tolerance can develop rapidly with these medications. Diphenhydramine (an ingredient commonly found in over-the-counter sleep aids) can have serious side effects for the elderly. <br/>Take daytime naps but no more than 45 minutes to 1 hour - longer naps may interfere with your sleep at night.<br/>Command yourself to go to sleep. This only makes your mind and body more alert. If you lie in bed awake for more than 20-30 minutes, get up, go to a different room (or part of the bedroom), participate in a quiet non-excitable activity and then return to bed when you feel sleepy. Do this as many times during the night, as needed. <br/>Continue to keep drinking fluids close to bedtime, instead stop drinking about 1.5 to 2 hours beforehand - if your mouth gets dry gargle with water and or Biotene mouth wash<br/><br/>Physical Activity<br/><br/>Please try to keep mentally and physically active as tolerated. Excerise is the most important neuroprotective strategy. You may incorporate stretching into your daily routine - stretching not only the muscles in the affected limbs but everywhere, including the back. This reduces the hunched posture and limited rang of motion that eventually develop. Although, stretching and aerobic activity may be beneficial, any exercise that suits you is the best one to continue. <br/><br/>Strength building exercises helps with endurance and may help with future balance issues. <br/><br/>Tai Chi and/or dance classes may be helpful as it will help focus on balance, movement, and fluidity. <br/><br/>Start slowly then try to build up as tolerated. Keep in mind that the more active you become to remember to increase water intake as well.<br/><br/></content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by Alzadon, Dina, APRN.CNP at 08/24/2023  5:10 PM EDT</span><br/><br/></li></ul></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id8" href="#toc">Progress Notes</a></h3><div><ul><li>Alzadon, Dina, APRN.CNP - 08/24/2023  1:15 PM PDT: <content><content><span class="xLabel">Formatting of this note is different from the original.</span><br/>CNR-MOVEMENT DISORDERS CENTER <br/><br/>Chief Complaint:<br/>Ms Margaret Charles presents today for follow up. She is a 74 year old right handed lady with Parkinson's disease, tremor predominant tremor predominant (2018). She is seen alone. This is my first time meeting with patient. She was last seen on 05/24/2023 by Dr. Zoltan Mari<br/><br/>Her main concerns today is her inability to eat and chronic pain<br/><br/>History of Present Illness: <br/>Ms. Charles presents today alone, she is a good historian.<br/> <br/>Ms. Charles reports that the symptoms were first noticed in or around year 2018.  It was right sided resting tremor in her hand.  She is also reporting some slight tremor in the right leg.  She has some leg pain.  Her dexterity is so far unaffected.<br/>Medication trials have included generic C/L - she was reporting worsening constipation and gastric upset.  She may have had her dizziness worsen on C/L.  She also tried Rytary, which was helpful, but she is not on it, due to the co-pay being too high for her ($100) and we are now considering an appeal.<br/>Ms. Charles also tried pramipexole and rasagiline since her last visit (12/23/2021), which did not work, having caused nausea and drowsiness.  She felt the Neupro patch was contributing to her pedal edema, but it was not, considering once she discontinued it, her pedal edema did not improve.  <br/>She is now back on the Neupro at 6 mg.<br/>She certainly progressed with regards her abilities and ADLs.<br/>Since then she was admitted to Summerlin Hospital and rehab.  She is now in an assisted living facility that she is not very happy with.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>She has fallen once since last visit and she was hospitalized at Canyon Vista Rehab for the month of May <br/>She has been in and out of the hospital for inability to be able to get assistance with preparing food as she is unable to serve/cook for herself<br/>She ambulates with a wheelchair and cane<br/>She drinks an average of 24oz of water daily and she is aware that it is not enough<br/>She tries to be physically active by having PT and she is not able to drive so she has HHPT<br/>She describes her sleep as OK because she takes Gabapentin. She has shooting pain up the left leg mostly which keeps her up if she doesn't take her medication<br/>She keeps mentally active by reading but her vision is poor and is unable to wear her contacts<br/>She had an MRI last week which showed a compression fracture and is unable to get someone to call her for an appt with her spine specialist<br/>She has had Botox for her neck spasms and it didn't work. She feels it is too expensive and the insurance did not cover about $800 of the bill. Patient is debilitated with anterocollis. <br/>She states she was doing fine until her husband died and her health began to deteriorate. Patient has 2 sons that live more in the East coast. One of which wanted her to live with him and his family but she declined as she doesn't "want to be a burden to them." However, she doesn't really have much support except for one friend she has here. In the meantime, she is in and out of the hospital for various reasons. <br/><br/>The following plan was developed with the previous visit:<br/>We provided extensive discussion and counseling regarding Parkinson disease. <br/>Physical therapy - continue at your facility.   <br/>Reviewed various options to reach clinic staff including via Telephone and review of MyChart.<br/>Medication recommendations continue Neupro at 6 mg.  We also are going to work on the appeal for your Rytary 95 mg at 1 capsule 3x/day for now - we will likely increase the dose to 3 capsules 3x/day later.<br/>Botox: if your neck spasms and pain worsen, we can schedule you for Botox injections.<br/>Stay well hydrated - we recommend 64 ounces daily fluid intake.<br/>Social work consultation to review best assisted living options.<br/>Education - please attend our 6/29/2023 education event.<br/><br/>  <br/>Parkinson's Medications Schedule:<br/> 10 AM 3PM 9/10PM <br/>Rytary 95mg  1 1 1 <br/>Neupro 4MG 1   <br/> <br/><br/>Review of Systems <br/>A twelve point Review of Systems (including neurologic ROS) was reviewed and was negative except for the following:<br/>*Cognition: The patient does not report significant problems with memory, cognition, and language functions.  <br/>*Psychiatric: There is no history of depression, anxiety, or hallucinations. <br/>*Sleep: Dream enactment is not present.
