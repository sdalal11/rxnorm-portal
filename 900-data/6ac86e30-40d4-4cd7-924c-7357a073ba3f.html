I will send a prescription for physical therapy for him to use when he is in the Philadelphia area (leaving in about a week).

He is his currently undertreated from the Parkinson's standpoint. I suggested increasing his levodopa dose by going to 2, 1-1/2, 2, 1-1/2 on the 4 times daily dosing. He can further increase this to two tablets 4 times daily over the next month. He has not had dyskinesia but does have wearing off problems. He should be exercising more regularly and I advised that he walk on a daily basis. He enjoys the exercise at the ankle bodily will continue that strategy.

He is his currently undertreated from the Parkinson's standpoint, despite 25/200 tablets 4 times a day (800 mg levodopa). I suggested increasing his levodopa dose 100 mg daily by going 25/250 strength tablets at 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., and stain with the two tablets of 25/100 at 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. I am hesitant had a dopamine agonist in his age group since hallucinations are a side effect that is common. He has mild left leg dyskinesia but overall is much more akinetic. He should be exercising more regularly and I advised that he walk on a daily basis. He enjoys the exercise at the dance ballet program and he will continue that strategy. I will have him go to the Gloria Drummond rehab program when he returns from his vacation in the Eastern Island, until he returns up North for the summer months.

On last visit I did increase his levodopa dose by 100 mg daily from 800 mg to 900 mg. He did not seem to feel there was any benefit from motor function and felt a cognitive decline on this change. I am reducing the Sinemet 25/100 back to 2 tablets daily (two tablets 4 times daily). He enjoys the exercise at the dance ballet program and he will continue that strategy. He has been attending the Gloria Drummond rehab program and will continue that program. I am starting on Aricept 5 mg (donepezil) in the morning to boost cognitive worse power. He is shown some decline according to the patient and his wife. Keeping his mind active is important now that he is retired must find activities that are cognitively stimulating. He will undergo a CT of the brain non-contrast, to evaluate brain anatomy.

                                                      This patient has Parkinson's disease stage III with postural impairment and akinesia. On last visit I did increase his levodopa dose by 100 mg daily from 800 mg to 900 mg. He does feel there was a benefit in his motor function and has continued that dose. He had a CT brain which was stable without significant atrophy of temporal lobe structures to suggest a developing dementia. He enjoys the exercise at the dance ballet program and he will continue that strategy. He did the Gloria Drummond rehab program and will has continue the exercises they instructed him in. I did encourage him to do some exercise on a daily basis.          
                                            <br/>
                                                      He will follow up using telemedicine in two months, and in six months office visit.

I did suggest a CT brain be obtained since his pacemaker is probably not MRI compatible. CT will show us at least his baseline anatomy whether not he has any hydrocephalus, what extent of small vessel cerebral vascular disease there is and exclude tumors or other unsuspected pathology he would prefer to wait until he is in the Philadelphia area where he spends the summer months, and where his daughter (a radiologist) lives. That is a reasonable plan. There is no urgency to brain imaging in this setting. I did ask in to see he gets a CD ROM so I can look at the images.  </span>

He had slowing of movements and was felt to have Parkinson's disease about 10 years ago. He was started on carbidopa/levodopa ( Sinemet) and has been gradually increased to the current dose of 1-1/2 tablet 4 times daily. He tells me he was tried by one neurologist on 2 tablets 4 times daily but he felt worse and did better on the lower dose. He does not have wearing off phenomena at the end of the dose, and he does not have dyskinesia or excessive movements. He has not had freezing of gait. He does have difficulty moving around in bed and less so getting out of bed. I did suggest a short bed rail for assistance in movement in bed. This device helps many Parkinson's patients maintain independent movement at night. He does have tremors in his legs at times more than hands. Tremor has never been a major feature. He does have slowing of his movements, and softened speech. He has been attending a Parkinson's disease oriented dance program two days a week at the Boca Ballet which is very vigorous. He still works part-time as CPA. He notes slight decrease in memory. He has not had hallucinations, nightmares, or sleep walking. This patient is seen today for follow-up regarding management of Parkinson's disease. Modifying factors are as above.  </span>

                                        <span class="content_span">   This 85-year-old man has a history of prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, permanent pacemaker in place, and prior spinal laminectomy surgeries. He had slowing of movements and was felt to have Parkinson's disease about 10 years ago. He was started on carbidopa/levodopa ( Sinemet) and has been gradually increased to the current dose of 1-1/2 tablet 4 times daily. On careful discussion he seems to have mild wearing off phenomena at the end of the dose, and he does not have dyskinesia or excessive movements. He has not had freezing of gait. He does have difficulty moving around in bed and less so getting out of bed. I did suggest a short bed rail for assistance in movement in bed. This device helps many Parkinson's patients maintain independent movement at night. He does have tremors in his legs at times more than hands, however, tremor has never been a major feature. He does have slowing of his movements, and softened speech. The patient and his wife both feel there is worsening of his balance and he has mild drooling. We did discuss glycopyrrolate but he does not want to take medications might aggravate his constipation. He has been attending a Parkinson's disease oriented dance program two days a week at the Boca Ballet which is very vigorous. He did have a Parkinson's disease therapy program last summer when he was up North. He has retired last six months from his job as a CPA. He has increase frequency of urination but mostly urgency, urologist suggested non related to prostate "likely neuro". He in the wife plan on going to the Easter Island location for a private tour in about two weeks. I did not think he would have major troubles with that the what is a long plane ride and he must get up and the I will a few times during the flight. On examination today he remains somewhat undertreated though he has a little dyskinesia of the left leg at times. Will increase slightly his levodopa dose to try and improve his function. I have advised him he would benefit from some physical therapy which can undertake when he comes back from the trip. He has not had hallucinations, or nightmares.   </span>

He feels that his memory decline somewhat with this change in his wife notices that he has more difficulty using the computer in the past month. They were able to take a trip who the Easter Island location for a private tour, then a cruise back to Fort Lauderdale through the Panama canal. He did have one fall during the trip. No significant injury occurred. I did recommend going back to the 200 mg levodopa times daily dosing.  </span>

He has been attending a Parkinson's disease oriented dance program two days a week at the Boca Ballet which is very vigorous. He is attending Gloria Drummond rehab for a Parkinson's disease therapy program. Earlier this year I did increase his carbidopa/levodopa slightly going up in his levodopa dose by 100 mg daily (from 800 to 900 mg/day). He has done this by taking a Sinemet 25/250 twice during the day (roughly 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.), with 2 tablets of 25/100 Sinemet used for the other two doses (roughly 12:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.). There has been some concern regarding cognitive decline but he does well on our office testing. The patient and his wife were able to take a trip to the Easter Island location for a private tour, then a cruise back to Fort Lauderdale through the Panama canal without problem. He did have one fall during the trip. No significant injury occurred. He did complete an exercise regimen, and he carries at those same exercises three days a week with his wife. I did advise him to do some exercise on a daily basis, at least a walk for 15 or 20 minutes. Did have a CT brain in May, 2024 which is normal for age without significant atrophy and good preservation of temporal lobe structures. He does not appear to be developing a degenerative dementia. Overall he in the white both feel he is doing reasonably well.  </span>
