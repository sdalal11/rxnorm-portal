Treating this condition is important for several reasons. It can cause blood clots, which can travel from your heart to your brain and cause a stroke. If you have a fast heartbeat, you may feel lightheaded, dizzy, and weak. An irregular heartbeat can also increase your risk for heart failure.<br/>Atrial fibrillation is often the result of another heart condition, such as high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. Making changes to improve your heart condition will help you stay healthy and active.<br/>Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.<br/>How can you care for yourself at home?<br/>Medicines<br/>  · Take your medicines exactly as prescribed. Call your doctor if you think you are having a problem with your medicine. You will get more details on the specific medicines your doctor prescribes. <br/>  · If your doctor has given you a blood thinner to prevent a stroke, be sure you get instructions about how to take your medicine safely. Blood thinners can cause serious bleeding problems. <br/>  · Do not take any vitamins, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal products without talking to your doctor first. <br/>Lifestyle changes<br/>  · Do not smoke. Smoking can increase your chance of a stroke and heart attack. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about stop-smoking programs and medicines. These can increase your chances of quitting for good. <br/>  · Eat a heart-healthy diet. <br/>  · Stay at a healthy weight. Lose weight if you need to. <br/>  · Limit alcohol to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. Too much alcohol can cause health problems. <br/>  · Avoid colds and flu. Get a pneumococcal vaccine shot. If you have had one before, ask your doctor whether you need another dose. Get a flu shot every year. If you must be around people with colds or flu, wash your hands often. <br/>Activity<br/>  · If your doctor recommends it, get more exercise. Walking is a good choice. Bit by bit, increase the amount you walk every day. Try for at least 30 minutes on most days of the week. You also may want to swim, bike, or do other activities. Your doctor may suggest that you join a cardiac rehabilitation program so that you can have help increasing your physical activity safely. <br/>  · Start light exercise if your doctor says it is okay. Even a small amount will help you get stronger, have more energy, and manage stress. Walking is an easy way to get exercise. Start out by walking a little more than you did in the hospital. Gradually increase the amount you walk. <br/>  · When you exercise, watch for signs that your heart is working too hard. You are pushing too hard if you cannot talk while you are exercising. If you become short of breath or dizzy or have chest pain, sit down and rest immediately. <br/>  · Check your pulse regularly. Place two fingers on the artery at the palm side of your wrist, in line with your thumb. If your heartbeat seems uneven or fast, talk to your doctor. <br/>When should you call for help?<br/> Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:<br/>  · You have symptoms of a heart attack. These may include:<br/>? Chest pain or pressure, or a strange feeling in the chest.<br/>? Sweating.<br/>? Shortness of breath.<br/>? Nausea or vomiting.<br/>? Pain, pressure, or a strange feeling in the back, neck, jaw, or upper belly or in one or both shoulders or arms.<br/>? Lightheadedness or sudden weakness.<br/>? A fast or irregular heartbeat.<br/>After you call 911, the operator may tell you to chew 1 adult-strength or 2 to 4 low-dose aspirin. Wait for an ambulance. Do not try to drive yourself. <br/>  · You have symptoms of a stroke. These may include:<br/>? Sudden numbness, tingling, weakness, or loss of movement in your face, arm, or leg, especially on only one side of your body.<br/>? Sudden vision changes.<br/>? Sudden trouble speaking.<br/>? Sudden confusion or trouble understanding simple statements.<br/>? Sudden problems with walking or balance.<br/>? A sudden, severe headache that is different from past headaches. <br/>  · You passed out (lost consciousness). <br/>Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:<br/>  · You have new or increased shortness of breath. <br/>  · You feel dizzy or lightheaded, or you feel like you may faint. <br/>  · Your heart rate becomes irregular. <br/>  · You can feel your heart flutter in your chest or skip heartbeats. Tell your doctor if these symptoms are new or worse. <br/>Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if you have any problems.<br/>Where can you learn more?<br/>Please go to www.healthwise.net/patiented and enter the 4-digit code shown below - or - if you have an OCHIN MyChart account for electronic access to your health record, please go to https://mychart.ochin.org and enter the 4-digit code shown below in the Health Library search box on your OCHIN MyChart welcome screen. <br/><br/>Enter U020 in the search box to learn more about "Atrial Fibrillation: Care Instructions." <br/>Available in English only.<br/>Current as of: August 31, 2020               Content Version: 12.9<br/>© 2006-2021 Healthwise, Incorporated. <br/>Care instructions adapted under license by OCHIN, Inc.

Healthwise, Incorporated disclaims any warranty or liability for your use of this information.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Patient Education <br/><br/> <br/>Learning About Your Stroke Risk When You Have Atrial Fibrillation<br/>How does atrial fibrillation affect your stroke risk?<br/>Normally, the heart beats in a strong, steady rhythm. In atrial fibrillation, the two upper parts of the heart (the atria) quiver, or fibrillate, and the heart does not beat in a regular rhythm. Your heart rate also may be faster than normal.<br/>This can be dangerous because if the heartbeat isn't strong and steady, blood can collect, or pool, in the heart. And pooled blood is more likely to form clots. Clots can travel to the brain, block blood flow, and cause a stroke.<br/>A stroke can cause sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body. Strokes can also cause sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding, or even trouble seeing in one or both eyes. Strokes can even cause death.<br/>Atrial fibrillation increases your stroke risk. But not everyone with atrial fibrillation has the same stroke risk.<br/>How do you know what your stroke risk is?<br/>Your doctor can help you know your risk based on your age, sex, and health.<br/>Things that raise your risk are called risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the higher your risk.<br/>Risk factors for stroke include:<br/>· Age. Being older than 65 raises your risk.<br/>· Being female. Women are at higher risk.<br/>· Other health problems. You may have other health problems that raise your risk. These include:<br/>? Heart failure.<br/>? High blood pressure.<br/>? A previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).<br/>? Heart attack, peripheral arterial disease, or other blood vessel disease.<br/>? Diabetes.<br/>Your doctor will use a kind of scorecard to add up your risk factors and estimate your risk for stroke. This score can help you and your doctor decide how to lower your risk.<br/>Should you take medicine to lower your stroke risk?<br/>When you know what your stroke risk is, you and your doctor can talk about your options. You'll decide whether or not to take medicine, called an anticoagulant, to help prevent blood clots.<br/>These medicines are often called blood thinners, but they don't actually thin your blood. Instead, they increase the time it takes for a blood clot to form.<br/>Blood thinners lower the risk of stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation. But how much your risk will be lowered depends on how high your risk was to start with.<br/>There are risks to taking a blood thinner. When your blood clots more slowly, you have a higher risk of bleeding problems. These problems include bleeding problems in and around the brain, bleeding in the stomach and intestines, bruising and bleeding if you are hurt, and serious skin rash.<br/>You and your doctor can compare your risk of stroke with your risk of bleeding from the medicine. You can also discuss how you feel about taking medicine every day.<br/>Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems.

Healthwise, Incorporated disclaims any warranty or liability for your use of this information.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Patient Education <br/><br/> <br/>Taking Direct Oral Anticoagulants Safely: Care Instructions<br/>Your Care Instructions<br/> <br/>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are medicines that help prevent blood clots. They also help treat problems caused by blood clots. These medicines are also called blood thinners.<br/>Blood thinners don't really thin the blood. They slow down the time it takes for a blood clot to form. They also keep existing blood clots from getting bigger. Blood thinners can help prevent a stroke caused by a heart rhythm problem (atrial fibrillation). This heart rhythm problem can form clots in the heart that can then go to the brain. Blood thinners can also help prevent or treat blood clots in the legs or lungs.<br/>Examples of DOACs include:<br/>· Apixaban (Eliquis).<br/>· Dabigatran (Pradaxa).<br/>· Edoxaban (Savaysa).<br/>· Rivaroxaban (Xarelto).<br/>Blood thinners can help save lives. But they can also cause problems. They can make you more likely to bleed. It's important to take them right and do everything you can to keep yourself safe.<br/>Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.<br/>How can you care for yourself at home?<br/>· Take your anticoagulant (blood thinner) exactly as your doctor prescribed them.<br/>· If you miss a dose, don't take an extra dose to make up for it. Your doctor can tell you exactly what to do so you don't take too much or too little.<br/>· Ask your pharmacist if you should take your blood thinner with food or without food.<br/>· Take your blood thinner at the same time every day. Be careful not to run out of them.<br/>· Ask your pharmacist how to store your blood thinner.<br/>· Don't take other medicines before talking to your doctor or pharmacist first. This includes prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. It also includes aspirin and other pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Motrin).<br/>· Tell your doctors, dentist, and pharmacist that you are taking a blood thinner.<br/>· Wear medical alert jewelry. This lets others know that you take a blood thinner. You can buy it at most drugstores.<br/>· If you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to get pregnant, tell your doctor. You and your doctor will decide what medicines are safe. If you are not planning on getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about how you can prevent pregnancy.<br/>· Try to avoid injuries. For example, be careful when you are exercising or playing sports. Make your home safe to reduce your risk of falling.<br/>When should you call for help?<br/> Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care.
