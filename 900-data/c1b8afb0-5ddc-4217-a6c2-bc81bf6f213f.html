Some lacerations heal on their own. Others need to be closed with stitches (sutures), staples, skin adhesive strips, or skin glue. Proper care of a laceration reduces the risk for infection, helps the laceration heal better, and may prevent scarring.<br/>How to care for your laceration<br/>Wash your hands with soap and water before touching your wound or changing your bandage (dressing). If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer.<br/>Keep the wound clean and dry.<br/>If you were given a dressing, you should change it at least once a day, or as told by your health care provider. You should also change it if it becomes wet or dirty.<br/>If sutures or staples were used:<br/>•	Keep the wound completely dry for the first 24 hours, or as told by your health care provider. After that time, you may shower or bathe. However, make sure that the wound is not soaked in water until after the sutures or staples have been removed.<br/>•	Clean the wound once each day, or as told by your health care provider:<br/>◦	Wash the wound with soap and water.<br/>◦	Rinse the wound with water to remove all soap.<br/>◦	Pat the wound dry with a clean towel. Do not rub the wound.<br/>•	After cleaning the wound, apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment as told by your health care provider. This will help prevent infection and keep the dressing from sticking to the wound.<br/>•	Have the sutures or staples removed as told by your health care provider.<br/>If skin adhesive strips were used:<br/>•	Do not get the skin adhesive strips wet. You may shower or bathe, but be careful to keep the wound dry.<br/>•	If the wound gets wet, pat it dry with a clean towel. Do not rub the wound.<br/>•	Skin adhesive strips fall off on their own. You may trim the strips as the wound heals. Do not remove skin adhesive strips that are still stuck to the wound. They will fall off in time.<br/>If skin glue was used:<br/>•	Try to keep the wound dry, but you may briefly wet it in the shower or bath. Do not soak the wound in water, such as by swimming.<br/>•	After you have showered or bathed, gently pat the wound dry with a clean towel. Do not rub the wound.<br/>•	Do not do any activities that will make you sweat heavily until the skin glue has fallen off on its own.<br/>•	Do not apply liquid, cream, or ointment medicine to the wound while the skin glue is in place. Using those may loosen the film before the wound has healed.<br/>•	If a dressing is placed over the wound, be careful not to apply tape directly over the skin glue. Doing that may cause the glue to be pulled off before the wound has healed.<br/>•	Do not pick at the glue. Skin glue usually remains in place for 5–10 days and then falls off the skin.<br/>General instructions<br/>•	Take over-the-counter and prescription medicines only as told by your health care provider.<br/>•	If you were prescribed an antibiotic medicine or ointment, take or apply it as told by your health care provider. Do not stop using it even if your condition improves.<br/>•	Do not scratch or pick at the wound.<br/>•	Check your wound every day for signs of infection. Watch for:<br/>◦	Redness, swelling, or pain.<br/>◦	Fluid, blood, or pus.<br/>•	Raise (elevate) the injured area above the level of your heart while you are sitting or lying down for the first 24–48 hours after the laceration is repaired.<br/>•	If directed, put ice on the affected area:<br/>◦	Put ice in a plastic bag.<br/>◦	Place a towel between your skin and the bag.<br/>◦	Leave the ice on for 20 minutes, 2–3 times a day.<br/>•	Keep all follow-up visits as told by your health care provider. This is important.<br/>Contact a health care provider if:<br/>•	You received a tetanus shot and you have swelling, severe pain, redness, or bleeding at the injection site.<br/>•	You have a fever.<br/>•	A wound that was closed breaks open.<br/>•	You notice a bad smell coming from your wound or your dressing.<br/>•	You notice something coming out of the wound, such as wood or glass.<br/>•	Your pain is not controlled with medicine.<br/>•	You have increased redness, swelling, or pain at the site of your wound.<br/>•	You have fluid, blood, or pus coming from your wound.<br/>•	You need to change the dressing often due to fluid, blood, or pus that is draining from the wound.<br/>•	You develop a new rash.<br/>•	You develop numbness around the wound.<br/>Get help right away if:<br/>•	You develop severe swelling around the wound.<br/>•	Your pain suddenly increases and is severe.<br/>•	You develop painful lumps near the wound or on skin anywhere else on your body.<br/>•	You have a red streak going away from your wound.<br/>•	The wound is on your hand or foot and you cannot properly move a finger or toe.<br/>•	The wound is on your hand or foot, and you notice that your fingers or toes look pale or bluish.<br/>Summary<br/>•	A laceration is a cut that may go through all layers of the skin and into the tissue that is right under the skin.<br/>•	Some lacerations heal on their own. Others need to be closed with stitches (sutures), staples, skin adhesive strips, or skin glue.<br/>•	Proper care of a laceration reduces the risk of infection, helps the laceration heal better, and prevents scarring.<br/>This information is not intended to replace advice given to you by your health care provider.

Learning to take long, deep breaths using this tool can help you keep your lungs clear and active. This may help to reverse or lessen your chance of developing breathing (pulmonary) problems, especially infection. You may be asked to use a spirometer:<br/>•	After a surgery.<br/>•	If you have a lung problem or a history of smoking.<br/>•	After a long period of time when you have been unable to move or be active.<br/>If the spirometer includes an indicator to show the highest number that you have reached, your health care provider or respiratory therapist will help you set a goal. Keep a list (log) of your progress as told by your health care provider.<br/>What are the risks?<br/>•	Breathing too quickly may cause dizziness or cause you to pass out. Take your time so you do not get dizzy or light-headed.<br/>•	If you are in pain, you may need to take pain medicine before doing incentive spirometry. It is harder to take a deep breath if you are having pain.<br/>How to use your incentive spirometer<br/>1.	Sit up on the edge of your bed or on a chair.<br/>2.	Hold the incentive spirometer so that it is in an upright position.<br/>3.	Before you use the spirometer, breathe out normally.<br/>4.	Place the mouthpiece in your mouth. Make sure your lips are closed tightly around it.<br/>5.	Breathe in slowly and as deeply as you can through your mouth, causing the piston or the ball to rise toward the top of the chamber.<br/>6.	Hold your breath for 3–5 seconds, or for as long as possible.<br/>•	If the spirometer includes a coach indicator, use this to guide you in breathing. Slow down your breathing if the indicator goes above the marked areas.<br/>7.	Remove the mouthpiece from your mouth and breathe out normally. The piston or ball will return to the bottom of the chamber.<br/>8.	Rest for a few seconds, then repeat the steps 10 or more times.<br/>•	Take your time and take a few normal breaths between deep breaths so that you do not get dizzy or light-headed.<br/>•	Do this every 1–2 hours when you are awake.<br/>9.	If the spirometer includes a goal marker to show the highest number you have reached (best effort), use this as a goal to work toward during each repetition.<br/>10.	After each set of 10 deep breaths, cough a few times. This will help to make sure that your lungs are clear.<br/>•	If you have an incision on your chest or abdomen from surgery, place a pillow or a rolled-up towel firmly against the incision when you cough. This can help to reduce pain from coughing.<br/>General tips<br/>•	When you become able to get out of bed, walk around often and continue to cough to help clear your lungs.<br/>•	Keep using the incentive spirometer until your health care provider says it is okay to stop using it. If you have been in the hospital, you may be told to keep using the spirometer at home.<br/>Contact a health care provider if:<br/>•	You are having difficulty using the spirometer.<br/>•	You have trouble using the spirometer as often as instructed.<br/>•	Your pain medicine is not giving enough relief for you to use the spirometer as told.<br/>•	You have a fever.<br/>•	You develop shortness of breath.<br/>Get help right away if:<br/>•	You develop a cough with bloody mucus from the lungs (bloody sputum).<br/>•	You have fluid or blood coming from an incision site after you cough.<br/>Summary<br/>•	An incentive spirometer is a tool that can help you learn to take long, deep breaths to keep your lungs clear and active.<br/>•	You may be asked to use a spirometer after a surgery, if you have a lung problem or a history of smoking, or if you have been inactive for a long period of time.<br/>•	Use your incentive spirometer as instructed every 1–2 hours while you are awake.<br/>•	If you have an incision on your chest or abdomen, place a pillow or a rolled-up towel firmly against your incision when you cough.
