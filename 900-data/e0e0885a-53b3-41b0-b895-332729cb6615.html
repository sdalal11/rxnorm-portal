                        <span class="content_span">Assessment:
Pt is a right-handed  66 year-old male presenting with a CC of chronic LBP w/o radiculopathy. 
He has good hip ROM.
He had an MVA in August 2022 and reported having some type of L4 fracture and developing LBP
He did not have any lumbar surgery.
His last lumbar radiographs were taken after the MVA in 2022.  

The impairments include: LBP, lumbar ROM, LE muscle performance, balance.
Because of the impairments, the patient has difficulty with prolonged standing and STS motions
The patient would benefit from skilled PT to decrease his pain and increase his core/LE strength, flexibility and endurance so that he can reach his goals.

Irritability level: mild
Pain mechanism: nociceptive (inflammatory mechanical versus ischemia)

Precautions: fall risk, DM, CAD, angina, on anticoagulants, gets dizziness when he stands up, pacemaker

Complicating factors: obesity, depression, deconditioning.

Prognosis for PT treatment for decreased pain and/or improved function: fair to good
Pt was told to stop any exercises that aggravate the pain and contact the office at his earliest convenience if there are any questions or problems with the exercises.

STG: In 3-4 visits pt will:
1.  Have low back pain decreased by at least 25%.
2.  Have less TTP of his lumbar spine.
3.  Report good compliance with the HEP and following self-care recommendations.

LTG: In 6-8 visits pt will:
1.  Have low back pain decreased by at least 50%.
2.  Have bilateral knee ext and hip flex strength increased by at least 1/2 grade to improve walking and standing.
3.  Be independent with the HEP and able to self manage pain.

Pt Education: continue with therex as able

Irritability level: moderate,
Pain mechanism: nociceptive (inflammatory-chemical versus  mechanical)

Precautions: fall risk, DM, CAD, angina, on anticoagulants, pacemaker

Treatment provided: 
- Therapeutic Exercise: 
sitting LAQ-stoped 2 to pain, supine heel slides 10x5 sec (1-2x/day), quad set with towel roll 10x2 sec (1-2x/day), sitting HS stretch 2x30 sec (1-2x/day)
- Education: continue with therex as able, use of cane in his left hand

Response to Treatment: pt had increased right knee pain with LAQ, but was able to perform the rest of his therex w/o pain

Pt was told to stop any exercises that aggravate the pain and contact the office at his earliest convenience if there are any questions or problems with the exercises.

This is a moderate complexity evaluation as supported by the following:  1-2 personal factors and/or comorbidities affecting POC; expanded profile and history; evolving clinical presentation; 3-5 performance deficits were identified; moderate clinical decision-making; detailed level of assessment.
