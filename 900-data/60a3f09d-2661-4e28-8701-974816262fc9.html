physically active is important as you age. Physical activity and exercise can help in maintaining quality of life, health, physical function, and reducing falls. The four types of exercises that are best for older adults are endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Contact your health care provider before you start any exercise routine. Ask your health care provider what activities are safe for you.<br/>What are the risks?<br/>Risks associated with exercising include:<br/>•	Overdoing it. This may lead to sore muscles or fatigue.<br/>•	Falls.<br/>•	Injuries.<br/>•	Dehydration.<br/>How to do these exercises<br/>Endurance exercises<br/>Endurance (aerobic) exercises raise your breathing rate and heart rate. Increasing your endurance helps you do everyday tasks and stay healthy. By improving the health of your body system that includes your heart, lungs, and blood vessels (circulatory system), you may also delay or prevent diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and weak bones (osteoporosis). Types of endurance exercises include:<br/>•	Sports.<br/>•	Indoor activities, such as using gym equipment, doing water aerobics, or dancing.<br/>•	Outdoor activities, such as biking or jogging.<br/>•	Tasks around the house, such as gardening, yard work, and heavy household chores like cleaning.<br/>•	Walking, such as hiking or walking around your neighborhood.<br/>When doing endurance exercises, make sure you:<br/>•	Are aware of your surroundings.<br/>•	Use safety equipment as directed.<br/>•	Dress in layers when exercising outdoors.<br/>•	Drink plenty of water to stay well hydrated.<br/>Build up endurance slowly. Start with 10 minutes at a time, and gradually build up to doing 30 minutes at a time. Unless your health care provider gave you different instructions, aim to exercise for a total of 150 minutes a week. Spread out that time so you are working on endurance 3 or more days a week.<br/>Strength exercises<br/>Lifting, pulling, or pushing weights helps to strengthen muscles. Having stronger muscles makes it easier to do everyday activities, such as getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, carrying groceries, and playing with grandchildren. Strength exercises include arm and leg exercises that may be done:<br/>•	With weights.<br/>•	Without weights (using your own body weight).<br/>•	With a resistance band.<br/>When doing strength exercises:<br/>•	Move smoothly and steadily. Do not suddenly thrust or jerk the weights, the resistance band, or your body.<br/>•	Start with no weights or with light weights, and gradually add more weight over time. Eventually, aim to use weights that are hard or very hard for you to lift. This means that you are able to do 8 repetitions with the weight, and the last few repetitions are very challenging.<br/>•	Lift or push weights into position for 3 seconds, hold the position for 1 second, and then take 3 seconds to return to your starting position.<br/>•	Breathe out (exhale) during difficult movements, like lifting or pushing weights. Breathe in (inhale) to relax your muscles before the next repetition.<br/>•	Consider alternating arms or legs, especially when you first start strength exercises.<br/>•	Expect some slight muscle soreness after each session.<br/>Do strength exercises on 2 or more days a week, for 30 minutes at a time. Avoid exercising the same muscle groups two days in a row. For example, if you work on your leg muscles one day, work on your arm muscles the next day. When you can do two sets of 10–15 repetitions with a certain weight, increase the amount of weight.<br/>Balance exercises<br/>Balance exercises can help to prevent falls. Balance exercises include:<br/>•	Standing on one foot.<br/>•	Heel-to-toe walk.<br/>•	Balance walk.<br/>•	Tai chi.<br/>Make sure you have something sturdy to hold onto while doing balance exercises, such as a sturdy chair. As your balance improves, challenge yourself by holding on to the chair with one hand instead of two, and then with no hands. Trying exercises with your eyes closed also challenges your balance, but be sure to have a sturdy surface (like a countertop) close by in case you need it.<br/>Do balance exercises as often as you want, or as often as directed by your health care provider.<br/>Flexibility exercises<br/>Flexibility exercises improve how far you can bend, straighten, move, or rotate parts of your body (range of motion). These exercises also help you do everyday activities such as getting dressed or reaching for objects. Flexibility exercises include stretching different parts of the body, and they may be done in a standing or seated position or on the floor.<br/>When stretching, make sure you:<br/>•	Keep a slight bend in your arms and legs. Avoid completely straightening ("locking") your joints.<br/>•	Do not stretch so far that you feel pain. You should feel a mild stretching feeling. You may try stretching farther as you become more flexible over time.<br/>•	Relax and breathe between stretches.<br/>•	Hold on to something sturdy for balance as needed.<br/>Hold each stretch for 10–30 seconds. Repeat each stretch 3–5 times.<br/>General safety tips<br/>•	Exercise in well-lit areas.<br/>•	Do not hold your breath during exercises or stretches.<br/>•	Warm up before exercising, and cool down after exercising. This can help prevent injury.<br/>•	Drink plenty of water during exercise or any activity that makes you sweat.<br/>•	If you are not sure if an exercise is safe for you, or you are not sure how to do an exercise, talk with your health care provider. This is especially important if you have had surgery on muscles, bones, or joints (orthopedic surgery).<br/>Where to find more information<br/>You can find more information about exercise for older adults from:<br/>•	Your local health department, fitness center, or community center. These facilities may have programs for aging adults.<br/>•	National Institute on Aging: www.nia.nih.gov<br/>•	National Council on Aging: www.ncoa.org<br/>Summary<br/>•	Staying physically active is important as you age.<br/>•	Doing endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises can help in maintaining quality of life, health, physical function, and reducing falls.<br/>•	Make sure to contact your health care provider before you start any exercise routine. Ask your health care provider what activities are safe for you.<br/>This information is not intended to replace advice given to you by your health care provider.

Exercise can also improve your mood and help with depression and anxiety.<br/>You may benefit from chair exercises if you are unable to do standing exercises due to:<br/>•	Diabetic foot pain.<br/>•	Obesity.<br/>•	Illness.<br/>•	Arthritis.<br/>•	Recovery from surgery or injury.<br/>•	Breathing problems.<br/>•	Balance problems.<br/>•	Another type of disability.<br/>Before starting chair exercises, check with your health care provider or a physical therapist to find out how much exercise you can tolerate and which exercises are safe for you. If your health care provider approves:<br/>•	Start out slowly and build up over time. Aim to work up to about 10–20 minutes for each exercise session.<br/>•	Make exercise part of your daily routine.<br/>•	Drink water when you exercise. Do not wait until you are thirsty. Drink every 10–15 minutes.<br/>•	Stop exercising right away if you have pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or dizziness.<br/>•	If you are exercising in a wheelchair, make sure to lock the wheels.<br/>•	Ask your health care provider whether you can do tai chi or yoga. Many positions in these mind-body exercises can be modified to do while seated.<br/>Warm-up<br/>Before starting other exercises:<br/>1.	Sit up as straight as you can. Have your knees bent at 90 degrees, which is the shape of the capital letter "L." Keep your feet flat on the floor.<br/>2.	Sit at the front edge of your chair, if you can.<br/>3.	Pull in (tighten) the muscles in your abdomen and stretch your spine and neck as straight as you can. Hold this position for a few minutes.<br/>4.	Breathe in and out evenly. Try to concentrate on your breathing, and relax your mind.<br/>Stretching<br/>Exercise A: Arm stretch<br/>1.	Hold your arms out straight in front of your body.<br/>2.	Bend your hands at the wrist with your fingers pointing up, as if signaling someone to stop. Notice the slight tension in your forearms as you hold the position.<br/>3.	Keeping your arms out and your hands bent, rotate your hands outward as far as you can and hold this stretch. Aim to have your thumbs pointing up and your pinkie fingers pointing down.<br/>4.	Slowly repeat arm stretches for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Exercise B: Leg stretch<br/>1.	If you can move your legs, try to "draw" letters on the floor with the toes of your foot. Write your name with one foot.<br/>2.	Write your name with the toes of your other foot.<br/>3.	Slowly repeat the movements for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Exercise C: Reach for the sky<br/>1.	Reach your hands as far over your head as you can to stretch your spine.<br/>2.	Move your hands and arms as if you are climbing a rope.<br/>3.	Slowly repeat the movements for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Range of motion exercises<br/>Exercise A: Shoulder roll<br/>1.	Let your arms hang loosely at your sides.<br/>2.	Lift just your shoulders up toward your ears, then let them relax back down.<br/>3.	When your shoulders feel loose, rotate your shoulders in backward and forward circles.<br/>4.	Do shoulder rolls slowly for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Exercise B: March in place<br/>1.	As if you are marching, pump your arms and lift your legs up and down. Lift your knees as high as you can.<br/>•	If you are unable to lift your knees, just pump your arms and move your ankles and feet up and down.<br/>2.	March in place for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Exercise C: Seated jumping jacks<br/>1.	Let your arms hang down straight.<br/>2.	Keeping your arms straight, lift them up over your head. Aim to point your fingers to the ceiling.<br/>3.	While you lift your arms, straighten your legs and slide your heels along the floor to your sides, as wide as you can.<br/>4.	As you bring your arms back down to your sides, slide your legs back together.<br/>•	If you are unable to use your legs, just move your arms.<br/>5.	Slowly repeat seated jumping jacks for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Strengthening exercises<br/>Exercise A: Shoulder squeeze<br/>1.	Hold your arms straight out from your body to your sides, with your elbows bent and your fists pointed at the ceiling.<br/>2.	Keeping your arms in the bent position, move them forward so your elbows and forearms meet in front of your face.<br/>3.	Open your arms back out as wide as you can with your elbows still bent, until you feel your shoulder blades squeezing together. Hold for 5 seconds.<br/>4.	Slowly repeat the movements forward and backward for one minute as tolerated.<br/>Contact a health care provider if:<br/>•	You have to stop exercising due to any of the following:<br/>◦	Pain.<br/>◦	Nausea.<br/>◦	Shortness of breath.<br/>◦	Dizziness.<br/>◦	Fatigue.<br/>•	You have significant pain or soreness after exercising.<br/>Get help right away if:<br/>•	You have chest pain.<br/>•	You have difficulty breathing.<br/>These symptoms may represent a serious problem that is an emergency. Do not wait to see if the symptoms will go away. Get medical help right away. Call your local emergency services (911 in the U.S.). Do not drive yourself to the hospital.<br/>Summary<br/>•	Exercises that you do while sitting (chair exercises) can strengthen your heart, burn calories, and keep muscles and joints healthy.<br/>•	You may benefit from chair exercises if you are unable to do standing exercises due to diabetic foot pain, obesity, recovery from surgery or injury, or other conditions.<br/>•	Before starting chair exercises, check with your health care provider or a physical therapist to find out how much exercise you can tolerate and which exercises are safe for you.<br/>This information is not intended to replace advice given to you by your health care provider.

Physical activity and exercise can help in maintaining quality of life, health, physical function, and reducing falls. The four types of exercises that are best for older adults are endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Contact your health care provider before you start any exercise routine. Ask your health care provider what activities are safe for you.<br/>What are the risks?<br/>Risks associated with exercising include:<br/>•	Overdoing it. This may lead to sore muscles or fatigue.<br/>•	Falls.<br/>•	Injuries.<br/>•	Dehydration.<br/>How to do these exercises<br/>Endurance exercises<br/>Endurance (aerobic) exercises raise your breathing rate and heart rate. Increasing your endurance helps you do everyday tasks and stay healthy. By improving the health of your body system that includes your heart, lungs, and blood vessels (circulatory system), you may also delay or prevent diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and weak bones (osteoporosis). Types of endurance exercises include:<br/>•	Sports.<br/>•	Indoor activities, such as using gym equipment, doing water aerobics, or dancing.<br/>•	Outdoor activities, such as biking or jogging.<br/>•	Tasks around the house, such as gardening, yard work, and heavy household chores like cleaning.<br/>•	Walking, such as hiking or walking around your neighborhood.<br/>When doing endurance exercises, make sure you:<br/>•	Are aware of your surroundings.<br/>•	Use safety equipment as directed.<br/>•	Dress in layers when exercising outdoors.<br/>•	Drink plenty of water to stay well hydrated.<br/>Build up endurance slowly. Start with 10 minutes at a time, and gradually build up to doing 30 minutes at a time. Unless your health care provider gave you different instructions, aim to exercise for a total of 150 minutes a week. Spread out that time so you are working on endurance 3 or more days a week.<br/>Strength exercises<br/>Lifting, pulling, or pushing weights helps to strengthen muscles. Having stronger muscles makes it easier to do everyday activities, such as getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, carrying groceries, and playing with grandchildren. Strength exercises include arm and leg exercises that may be done:<br/>•	With weights.<br/>•	Without weights (using your own body weight).<br/>•	With a resistance band.<br/>When doing strength exercises:<br/>•	Move smoothly and steadily. Do not suddenly thrust or jerk the weights, the resistance band, or your body.<br/>•	Start with no weights or with light weights, and gradually add more weight over time. Eventually, aim to use weights that are hard or very hard for you to lift. This means that you are able to do 8 repetitions with the weight, and the last few repetitions are very challenging.<br/>•	Lift or push weights into position for 3 seconds, hold the position for 1 second, and then take 3 seconds to return to your starting position.<br/>•	Breathe out (exhale) during difficult movements, like lifting or pushing weights. Breathe in (inhale) to relax your muscles before the next repetition.<br/>•	Consider alternating arms or legs, especially when you first start strength exercises.<br/>•	Expect some slight muscle soreness after each session.<br/>Do strength exercises on 2 or more days a week, for 30 minutes at a time. Avoid exercising the same muscle groups two days in a row. For example, if you work on your leg muscles one day, work on your arm muscles the next day. When you can do two sets of 10–15 repetitions with a certain weight, increase the amount of weight.<br/>Balance exercises<br/>Balance exercises can help to prevent falls. Balance exercises include:<br/>•	Standing on one foot.<br/>•	Heel-to-toe walk.<br/>•	Balance walk.<br/>•	Tai chi.<br/>Make sure you have something sturdy to hold onto while doing balance exercises, such as a sturdy chair. As your balance improves, challenge yourself by holding on to the chair with one hand instead of two, and then with no hands. Trying exercises with your eyes closed also challenges your balance, but be sure to have a sturdy surface (like a countertop) close by in case you need it.<br/>Do balance exercises as often as you want, or as often as directed by your health care provider.<br/>Flexibility exercises<br/>Flexibility exercises improve how far you can bend, straighten, move, or rotate parts of your body (range of motion). These exercises also help you do everyday activities such as getting dressed or reaching for objects. Flexibility exercises include stretching different parts of the body, and they may be done in a standing or seated position or on the floor.<br/>When stretching, make sure you:<br/>•	Keep a slight bend in your arms and legs. Avoid completely straightening ("locking") your joints.<br/>•	Do not stretch so far that you feel pain. You should feel a mild stretching feeling. You may try stretching farther as you become more flexible over time.<br/>•	Relax and breathe between stretches.<br/>•	Hold on to something sturdy for balance as needed.<br/>Hold each stretch for 10–30 seconds.
