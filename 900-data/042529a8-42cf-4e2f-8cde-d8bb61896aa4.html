Losing weight may help keep your arteries open so that your heart can get the oxygen-rich blood it needs. Weight loss can also help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk for diabetes. All in all, losing weight makes you healthier.<br/> <br/>Exercise with a friend. When activity is fun, you're more likely to stick with it. <br/>Calories and weight loss<br/>· Calories are the fuel your body burns for energy. You get the calories you need from the food you eat. For healthy weight loss, women should eat at least 1,200 calories a day, men at least 1,500.<br/>· When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as fat. One pound of fat equals 3,500 calories.<br/>· To lose weight, try to burn 500 calories a day more than you eat. To do this, eat 250 calories less each day. Add activity to burn the other 250 calories. Walking 2.5 miles burns about 250 calories.<br/>· Eat a variety of healthy foods to get the nutrients you need.<br/>Tips for losing weight<br/>· Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water a day.<br/>· Don’t skip meals. Instead, eat smaller portions. <br/>Brisk activity is best<br/>Brisk activity gets your heart pumping faster and it makes it healthier. It’s also a great way to burn calories. In fact, your body may keep burning calories for hours after you stop a brisk activity:<br/>· Begin by walking 10 minutes most days.<br/>· Add more time and speed to your walk. Build up as you feel able.<br/>· Aim for 3 to 4 sessions of aerobic exercise a week. Each session should last about 40 minutes and include moderate to vigorous physical activity. <br/>© 2000-2016 The StayWell Company, LLC. 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067.

Always follow your healthcare professional's instructions.<br/><br/>Your Body Mass Index (BMI) was found to be above the recommended healthy range, this suggests that your weight may be too high.Here you have some helpful educational material. <br/>Exercise: Fitting It into Your Life<br/>Recent studies show that several short activity breaks during the day can add up to better health. You don’t have to fit your life around activity. Instead, you can fit activity into your daily life.<br/><br/>Getting Started<br/>Take a minute to look at your day. From start to finish, there are bits of time that could add up to a gold mine of activity. You just have to find them. It may be while you’re waiting for water to boil or for a computer to start. All you need is 30 minutes of movement on most days to find better health. Aim for a total of 150 or more minutes a week. You can do whatever movement suits you. Examples are walking, jogging in place, and climbing up and down stairs. Your choices will always be ones that work best for you.<br/>Act Like a Kid<br/>What young child ever wants to sit still? Kids never plan activity. They just move. Here are some ideas to help you act more like a kid:<br/>· Dress to move. Comfortable shoes and clothing help you want to move more. Stand more at meetings. Or walk to the farthest water fountain on a break.<br/>· Be a participant, not an observer. Forget the sidelines. Jump in for a game of Ping-Pong or to shoot a few baskets.<br/>· Seek active fun. Kids don’t sit and chat over soda. They jump and run. So instead of sitting over coffee to visit with a friend, stroll through a park or mall.<br/>Just Move<br/>Build bits of movement into what you already do. Let’s look at some examples of ways you can start:<br/>Instead of: sitting in the bleachers at your child’s soccer game or in the doctor’s waiting room,<br/>Try to: do a lap around the field or take a quick walk up and down the stairs.<br/>Instead of: choosing electric or power tools and appliances,<br/>Try to: whip, mix, mow, or hammer by hand.<br/>Instead of: sending an e-mail or voicemail at work,<br/>Try to: walk to your coworker to talk in person.<br/>Instead of: just sitting while watching TV or driving a car,<br/>Try to: tighten your abdominal (stomach) muscles for a minute, or stretch your shoulders or neck.<br/>Instead of: taking an elevator or escalator at the mall,<br/>Try to: walk up the escalator or find stairs to use.<br/>If interested, please discuss with your primary care provider about possible next steps. If needed, your provider can refer you to an appropriate health care professional.<br/><br/>© 2000-2014 Krames StayWell, 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067. All rights reserved.

Additional degenerative changes of the right shoulder and cervical spine as detailed in the body report.<br/><br/> <br/> Assessment: <br/>Previous clinic notes<br/>The patient is a 67-year-old lady well-known to me from previous lobe right lower lobectomy for lung cancer many years ago.  She has been followed with me.  Her main issue at this point is COPD and significant depression.  I have been seeing her every year and there is a lesion in the lateral aspect of the right middle lobe that  shows sign  of growth.  Whether this is a scar from her underlying COPD performed for pulmonary fibrosis or a new primary is not clear.  It is however clear that this lesion has increased in size on subsequent CT scans.<br/>I disclosed this finding to the patient I request to proceed with evaluation including pulmonary function test and a PET scan she will come back to see me in few weeks<br/>Patient return to clinic for follow-up visit.  I have known this lady for more than 10years following right lower lobectomy for lung cancer.  The patient has significant anxiety every time she comes to see me for CT scan surveillance.  In the last CT scan there was a new lesion in the lateral aspect of the right middle lobe.  Compared to previous CT scan this lesion has shown growth in size.  I offer the patient undergo further work-up with PFTs and PET scan.  The PET scan showed this lesion is PET avid PFT showed normal spirometry however significant reduced DLCO the blood gas showed that she has mild metabolic acidosis and carbon monoxide hemoglobin 3% indicating exposure to cigarette smoke's.  Patient deeply declined personal smoking history however up to 6 months ago and however she has exposure to secondhand smoke at home.<br/>I  communicated with IR specialist about transthoracic needle biopsy.  Dr. Venkat expressed concern that she would develop pneumothorax.  I encouraged her to  talk to the patient to see if patient  would change her mind and decide to proceed with surgical resection.  Once she decide to go with surgical resection I will further evaluate for preop stress test<br/>Patient return to see me after having telephone consultation with Dr. Venkat regarding the wrist interval with transthoracic biopsy upper peripherally located subpleural nodule against the chest wall.  Dr. Venkat also communicated with me that there is increased risk of pneumothorax because of her underlying COPD.  Patient became concerned and she return to see me regarding my recommendation.<br/>I spent 45 minutes with the patient in the presence of her family members on the phone and in in the clinic visit with me and my nurse acting as a transfer translator.<br/>I clearly outlined to her that there are risks involved with both approaches<br/>The first approach is surgical intervention as I initially recommended I can envision degrees of difficulties with the operation as patient most likely has pleurisy and pleural adhesions due to previous pneumonia pleural effusion many years ago and some pleural thickening on CT scan of the chest however that would not interfere with the abilities to dissect out the lung from the chest wall and resect this tumor.  Certainly with her abnormal PFT amf low DLCO and the risk of a postoperative complication would  increase namely prolonged air leaks,  respiratory failure requiring brief postop oxygen supplementation  I indicated to her that the risk of the surgery would be offset by the benefit of removing the lesion completely as a curative therapy for a slow-growing lesion most likely a recurrence most likely second primarythe patient expressed an reservation of the surgical intervention on last clinic visit that prompted me to send the patient for biopsy in preparation for referral to radiation oncology for SBRT.  She  Comes back to see me because she wants me to hear  my recommendation again.  I clearly indicated to her that the biopsy would give us a tissue diagnosis and the radiation oncologist would need the Dx to offer SBRT.  However she need to understand that the biopsy may turn out to be negative and then we have to deal with that as it comes.<br/>At the end of the very long discussion with the patient really on the fence unable to make decision I told her that the best and safest approach would be to default onto the least invasive approach which is a transthoracic biopsy and I told her that I do not think the risk of pneumothorax is as high as expected because she most likely had pleural adhesions and the tumor is against the chest wall and on the surface of the lung pneumothorax would be less.<br/>At the end of discussion patient agreed to proceed with the biopsy which is scheduled for next Thursday 728.  I will see her again 2 weeks after that<br/><br/>Patient returns clinic for follow-up visit.  She had the biopsy done for the right lung nodule that this lesion is suspicious because it grew over time and PET positive is subpleural location.  Biopsy did not show any specific diagnosis.  There is a possibility is that it is false negative however there is a possibility that this lesion is nonmalignant. The best course of action would be resection<br/><br/>I had a very long discussion with patient obviously disappointed but the outcome is not totally unexpected as I explained to her in the past that there is a chance of false negative reading with biopsy as well.  Since the patient is extremely averse to any surgery intervention I offer the patient to go repeat CT scan chest in 4 months.<br/><br/>The PET scan shows some abnormality in the head of the left clavicle I ordered. Bone MRI.  I also asked Dr. TY Subhawong bone radiology to review and give me some insight to the abnormality  Thois P{ET lesion in headof elft   clavicle likely to be inflammatorybut would have to rule evidence of blood metastasis in somebody with a history of lung cancer and head neck cancer in the past<br/><br/>Current clinic visit note<br/>Patient rectal return to clinic as previously scheduled.  She had MRI of the clavicle and there was no abnormalities no evidence of metastasis.<br/><br/>With regard to the right lung lesion that was biopsy and no definite diagnosis was made patient still on the left patient is still reluctant to have any surgical resection.  I told her thatI could refer her to radiation oncologist but they would not radiate without tissue diagnosis.<br/><br/>At this point the only approach that she would agree to is follow-up with a CT scan of the chest I would do it in 4 months.<br/><br/>I am quite concerned about this lesion to be a second lung primary but she is very reluctant to have any surgery intervention at all she understanding the risk of tumor progression with  waiting and watching and CT scan chest in 4 months<br/> <br/> Plan: <br/><br/>-RTC on 12/1/22 w/ same day CT Chest w/o contrast<br/><br/>I spent 30 minutes with the patient and accompanying family members, &gt;80% of the face-to-face involved with H&amp;P, extensive review of electronic medical records, other pertinent medical notes, review of imaging studies, in-depth counseling with the patient about diagnosis/plan of care/professional recommendations, my discussion with referring MD and my planning of future care.<br/><br/>Dao M.
