Ventricular Enlargement:  Mild to moderate enlargement of lateral and third ventricles. Periventricular White Matter Hyperintensities:  Mild -moderate, diffuse. Deep White Matter Hyperintensities: Moderate bilateral anterior and posterior WMHs . Lacunar and Cortical Infarcts: None. Hippocampal Atrophy:  Moderate -severe on the left;  Severe on the right. Entorhinal Cortex Atrophy: Moderate on the Left; Severe on the Right.<br/>Assessment: These findings are consistent with and suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder, most likely the medial temporal predominant form of Alzheimer's disease. Minimal evidence for a vascular cause for the dementia/cognitve impairment is present (in the form of WMH, without infarcts). There is no evidence of Amyloid Angiopathy..   <br/><br/>INITIAL DIAGNOSIS:<br/>Cognitive Status:  Severe Dementia <br/>MMSE: 8/30, NCGS:  /60) <br/>Neurological Diagnoses: Neurodegenerative Disorder unspecified <br/>Psychiatric Symptoms: Anxiety Disorder NOS, Delusions/Paranoid State Unspecified, Depression NOS and Personality change due to conditions classified elsewhere <br/><br/>  <br/> Assessment: <br/> <br/>Cognitive: severe Dementia, overall stable in testing (MMSE 8/30), previosly MMSE 10/30<br/><br/>Functional: Independent for most basic ADLs  Dependent for all IADLs <br/><br/>Behavioral: disinhibited behavior, anxiety, delusional ideations (with episodes of anxiety/agitation)<br/><br/>Physical: back pain<br/><br/>Imaging/Lab findings: see above <br/><br/>Differential Diagnosis: Alzheimer's Disease (late onset) <br/><br/>Caregiver status: concerned and stressed-referred to caregiver support groups with Maria Ruiz, LMHC<br/> <br/>Plan:<br/> <br/> <br/>Diagnostic tests ordered: None<br/><br/>Medications ordered (for):<br/><br/>Discontinue Lexapro 20 mg PO Qam (take 10 mg po daily in the morning for 3 days then discontinue)<br/><br/>Start: Cymbalta 30 mg po daily in the morning <br/><br/>Continue Trazodone 150 mg at bedtime (for insomnia and mood stability). <br/>Continue galantamine ER 16 mg For memory<br/>Continue quetiapine to 100 mg at bedtime (pt does not tolerate 150 mg)<br/>Continue Namenda XR 14 mg daily<br/><br/>I interpreted today's neuropsychological testing results, and discussed results with patient/caregiver. This was included in today's clinical decision-making, treatment planning and report. <br/><br/>Educated patient/caregiver regarding benefit vs risk of medication prescribed above. I educated patient/caregiver on possibleside effects that may occur, and advised to call the office if patient exhibits any side effects or adverse reaction to medication.<br/><br/>I provided the following recommendations for today's visit:   <br/>-Mental exercise, such as reading, doing puzzles, playing cards. <br/>-Follow the Mediterranean diet - olive oil, nuts, fish, vegetables, legumes, fruit, whole grains, moderate dairy products, limit intake of red meat. <br/>-Treat cardiac risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, (BP120/80, LDL under 100 mg/dl, fasting glucose under 100 mg/dl, BMI under 27.)<br/>-Exercise, such as walking, 20-25 minutes daily. <br/>-Avoid medications that make memory worse, especially anticholinergics, e.g., Benadryl, Tylenol PM, Ditropan and sedatives, e.g., Ambien, Valium. <br/>-Socialization (e.g., spend time with family and friends). <br/>-Quality sleep - tell your doctor if at night you have loud snoring or episodes of breathing cessation or gasping. <br/>-Follow a predictable daily routine.<br/><br/>• The above information was discussed at length and detail with the patient/family who was also given ample opportunity to ask questions and verbalize understanding of the plan. <br/><br/>• The appropriate follow up has been arranged. I have advised the patient and family to contact me if any questions/problems arise prior to the follow up.<br/><br/>Encouraged to attend ADC.<br/><br/>Recommend to speak with Maria Ruiz and provided education on progression of neurodegenerative disease and caregiver role.<br/><br/>Follow-up appointment for: 2 months<br/><br/>45 minutes was spent administering neuropsychological testing evaluation, including, interpretation of test results and clinical data, clinical decision making, treatment planning and report.  <br/> <br/>The patient was referred for the following service(s): <br/><br/></content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by Dunia Fernandez Montero, APRN at 10/31/2023  8:13 AM EDT</span><br/></content></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id7" href="#toc">Plan of Treatment</a></h3><div><table><span style="font-weight:bold; ">Upcoming Encounters</span><colgroup><col width="10%"/><col width="15%"/><col width="25%" span="3"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Date</th><th>Type</th><th>Department</th><th>Care Team (Latest Contact Info)</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="encounter32" class="xRowNormal"><td>06/20/2025  4:00 PM EDT</td><td ID="encounter32type">Telemedicine</td><td><p>Mount Sinai Alzheimer's Miami Beach</p><p>4302 Alton Rd</p><p>Ste 650</p><p>Miami Beach, FL 33140-2800</p><p>305-674-2543</p></td><td><p>Fernandez Montero, Dunia, APRN</p><p>4302 ALTON RD STE 650</p><p>MIAMI BEACH, FL 33140</p><p>305-674-2543 (Work)</p><p>305-674-2996 (Fax)</p></td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id8" href="#toc">Visit Diagnoses</a></h3><div><table><colgroup><col width="100%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="vdx4" class="xRowNormal"><td><p><span class="content_span">Depression, unspecified depression type</span><span class="content_span"> - Primary</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id9" href="#toc">Care Teams</a></h3><div><table ID="ct43"><colgroup><col width="25%" span="3"/><col width="13%"/><col width="12%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Team Member</th><th>Relationship</th><th>Specialty</th><th>Start Date</th><th>End Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td><p>Prida, Karen</p><p>NPI: 1033379896</p><p>15761 SW 59 TERR</p><p>MIAMI, FL 33193</p><p>305-269-2550 (Work)</p><p>305-269-2544 (Fax)</p></td><td>PCP - General</td><td/><td>7/28/23</td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><br/><br/></body></html>
