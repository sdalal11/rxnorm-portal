Patient had 1 week hospital stay, followed by 2 week stay at [REDACTED] (SNF). He followed up with [REDACTED] on [REDACTED] who now refers him to OPPT for aquatic therapy. <br/><br/>PLOF:  Per patient independent with bed mobility and transfers, able to go up/down stairs at home with hand rails.  Ambulated with single point cane prior to first back surgery last year. <br/><br/>CLOF:  Patient reports pain across lumbar spine (R more than L) which increases with standing and walking.  He ambulates with rolling [REDACTED], supervision and slow antalgic gait.  He and needs SBA bilat UE support to rise from chair. He is unable to hold standing balance more than 5-10 seconds without UE support, unable to stand or walk more than 5-10 minutes with rolling [REDACTED] due to pain, and unable to go up 16 stairs in his home without assistance (wife pushes him from behind). <br/><br/>Patient presents with flexed forward posture, decreased bilat hip and R ankle strength, decreased balance, weak abdominals and trunk extensor muscles and [REDACTED] balance test that indicates fall risk. <br/><br/>Recommend skilled PT service to address impairments, decrease pain, decrease fall risk and maximize functional independence. <br/><br/>[REDACTED], PT <br/><br/>[REDACTED] 1115 P.T. Progress Note Completed. Patient completes 6 visits since last evaluation for above diagnosis. The patient reports no significant difference in pain levels, however aquatic PT sessions help to relax lumbar spine musculature. Patient's Oswestry score is 32/50, indicating no clinical important difference in pain levels. Patient's TUG (with RW) score improved from 33 seconds at initial evaluation to 28 seconds [REDACTED]. When ambulating, patient noted with slow cadence, decreased hip and knee flexion, and increased weight bearing into UE's. Patient reports his walking tolerance is approximately 3-5 minutes. Patient continues to be a fall risk secondary to gait pattern. When assessing MMT, patient's LE strength grossly 4-/5 (with exception of hip extension 3-/5). Patient reports his referring physician will be sending another referral for continued aquatic PT services. Patient was educated on importance of access to a pool for compliance with HEP after discharge, patient verbalized understanding however has concerns about going into a pool unattended secondary to balance deficits. <br/><br/>Plan: Continue skilled PT service to address impairments, decrease pain, decrease fall risk and maximize functional independence. <br/><br/>[REDACTED], DPT<br/><br/>[REDACTED] 1200 POC completed. Pt seen for plan of care secondary to above diagnosis. Pt has been seen for 8 aquatic treatment sessions since last assessment. Pt reports no difference in pain levels since beginning physical therapy. Pt's Oswestry score is 29/50 indicating no significant change since evaluation. Discussed with patient the importance of being compliant with HEP to improve functional outcomes. [REDACTED] balance score has remained unchanged due to pain in R hip, limiting his ability to balance without RW. Additionally, instructed pt to ambulate close to RW and to decrease his cadence for safety (tends to speed up when he is ambulating with RW). MMT scores of R hip and knee are as follows: flexion 4-/5, extension 3-/5, abduction 3-/5, knee flexion 3/5, and knee <br/>extension 3/5. Pt states he would like to use weight machines instead of performing mat exercises to further challenge his functional LE/core strength. <br/><br/>Plan: Pt will benefit from skilled OP P.T intervention in order to address above impairments and functional limitation  with emphasis on his trunk and hip core/stability,  Posture control, fitness endurance, LE strength, gait,  ADL's  And functional mobility with proper body mechanics and HEP for maximum functional outcomes and independence.<br/><br/>Patient Education<br/>Who was taught?

Patient was educated on importance of access to a pool for compliance with HEP after discharge, patient verbalized understanding however has concerns about going into a pool unattended secondary to balance deficits. <br/><br/>Plan: Continue skilled PT service to address impairments, decrease pain, decrease fall risk and maximize functional independence. <br/><br/>[REDACTED], DPT<br/><br/>[REDACTED] 1200 POC completed. Pt seen for plan of care secondary to above diagnosis. Pt has been seen for 8 aquatic treatment sessions since last assessment. Pt reports no difference in pain levels since beginning physical therapy. Pt's Oswestry score is 29/50 indicating no significant change since evaluation. Discussed with patient the importance of being compliant with HEP to improve functional outcomes. [REDACTED] balance score has remained unchanged due to pain in R hip, limiting his ability to balance without RW. Additionally, instructed pt to ambulate close to RW and to decrease his cadence for safety (tends to speed up when he is ambulating with RW). MMT scores of R hip and knee are as follows: flexion 4-/5, extension 3-/5, abduction 3-/5, knee flexion 3/5, and knee <br/>extension 3/5. Pt states he would like to use weight machines instead of performing mat exercises to further challenge his functional LE/core strength. <br/><br/>Plan: Pt will benefit from skilled OP P.T intervention in order to address above impairments and functional limitation  with emphasis on his trunk and hip core/stability,  Posture control, fitness endurance, LE strength, gait,  ADL's  And functional mobility with proper body mechanics and HEP for maximum functional outcomes and independence.<br/><br/>Treatment Plan:<br/>Modalities, Aquatic Therapy, Therapeutic Exercise, Therapeutic Activities, Gait Training, Manual Therapy Treatment, Neuromuscular Re-Education, Self Care/Home Management Training and Patient/Family Education<br/><br/>Additional Instructions:<br/>3x/week for 2 weeks on LAND, then 3x/week for 3 weeks in POOL<br/><br/>Potential:<br/>Patient Has Good Potential for Physical Therapy Services<br/>Visit Duration:<br/>Recommended duration of treatment: 45 minutes<br/>Visits per week: 3<br/>Weeks: 5<br/>Total Number of Visits: 15<br/><br/>Certification:<br/>Start Date: [REDACTED]<br/>End Date: [REDACTED]<br/><br/>The plan of care has been developed in collaboration with the patient and/or family and other disciplines as indicated.<br/><br/>Electronically signed by: [REDACTED], PT<br/><br/>I HAVE REVIEWED THIS PLAN OF CARE AND CERTIFY THAT THESE SERVICES ARE REASONABLE AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR THIS PATIENT:<br/><br/>Dr.                                                                           <br/>                         Physician Name (Print)<br/><br/>Signature:                                                ID#:                    Date:                         Time:                     <br/><br/>Phone #:                                                                 <br/><br/>Fax #:                                                                  <br/><br/>Address:                                                              <br/><br/>THIS TREATMENT PLAN IS TO SERVE AS A PRESCRIPTION AND INCLUDES THE NECESSARY COMPONENTS<br/></content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by [REDACTED], PT at [REDACTED]  3:56 PM EDT</span><br/></content></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id6" href="#toc">Plan of Treatment</a></h3><div><p>Not on file</p>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id7" href="#toc">Goals</a></h3><div><table><colgroup><col width="30%"/><col width="10%"/><col width="15%"/><col width="20%"/><col width="12%"/><col width="13%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Goal</th><th>Patient Goal Type</th><th>Associated Problems</th><th>Recent Progress</th><th>Patient-Stated?</th><th>Author</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td><p>Exercise 3x per week (30 min per time)</p></td><td>Exercise</td><td/><td/><td>No</td><td>[REDACTED], [REDACTED], MA</td></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id8" href="#toc">Visit Diagnoses</a></h3><div><span class="content_span">Not on file</span>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id9" href="#toc">Additional Health Concerns</a></h3><div><table><colgroup><col span="2" width="50%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Assessment</th><th>Noted Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td ID="assessment1">PHQ-9 Depression Total Score: 0</td><td>[REDACTED] 11:15 AM EDT</td></tr><tr class="xRowAlt"><td ID="assessment2">A Body Mass Index follow-up plan has been documented for the patient</td><td>[REDACTED]  2:07 PM EDT</td></tr><tr class="xRowNormal"><td ID="assessment3">PHQ-2 Depression Total Score: 0</td><td>[REDACTED]  9:21 AM EST</td></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id10" href="#toc">Care Teams</a></h3><div><table ID="ct51"><colgroup><col span="3" width="25%"/><col width="13%"/><col width="12%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Team Member</th><th>Relationship</th><th>Specialty</th><th>Start Date</th><th>End Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td><p>English, [REDACTED], MD</p><p>NPI: [REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td>PCP - General</td><td>Family Medicine</td><td>[REDACTED]</td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><br/><br/>
