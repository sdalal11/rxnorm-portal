On [REDACTED] he had lab work done by his PCP and his PSA level was drawn, and it was reported back as 34.5 ng/mL. CT AP and Bone scan of early June revealed multiple sclerotic bone lesions many of which may either be new or more conspicuous concerning for osseous metastatic disease. PET PSMA scan of [REDACTED] revealed Findings strongly favored for extensive nodal and skeletal tracer avid metastatic disease likely represent metastatic prostate cancer. <br/><br/>He followed up with urologist Dr. [REDACTED] and his last appointment was on [REDACTED] regarding metastatic prostate cancer and discussion about ADT.<br/><br/>Patient also has a past medical history of melanoma resection from the back in [REDACTED]. Most recently the patient was evaluated by [REDACTED] for induration outside and inside of his right ear. Subsequently underwent resection of tumor on the right of the face on [REDACTED] which resulted on Squamous cell carcinoma. <br/><br/>He also Began adjuvant chemoradiation to the right parotid bed/ neck on [REDACTED] with [REDACTED] and Dr. [REDACTED]. The recommended regimen was weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. Completed 7 weeks of treatment on [REDACTED]. Then was see at the CTU for zarxio on 7/16, 7/17, and 7/18 and hydration. <br/><br/>PSA History<br/>[REDACTED] - 2.5<br/>[REDACTED] - 4.90<br/>[REDACTED] - 34.5<br/><br/>Both father and brother passed from heart attack. Mother passed from breast cancer. Never had past medical issues of significance. Past endoscopy revealed [REDACTED] syndrome. Rescheduled colonoscopy recently. Planned to start [REDACTED] and ERLEADA. Discussed side effects of both medications. <br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Patient here for follow up visit. Feels better for the past 3 days. Better appetite with [REDACTED], but feels he needs more help with appetite. I have recommended Marinol. He also notes that his energy has improved. Chemo and radiation for squamous cell was completed aver [REDACTED] now. On Ct scan he had acute diverticulitis which was treated with antibiotics, finished a few days ago and has helped. We have discussed his negative bronch biopsy pathology. We have discussed his PSA which has reduced from 34.5 to 23 without treatment. He has not started on [REDACTED] nor on Erleada. We have discussed his elevated PSA and results of last PET PSMA scan. Informed patient about starting hormone therapy prior to Pluvicto. However, patient would need financial assistance due to high co-pay for Lupron and Erleada. <br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Patient here for follow up visit. Feels he has improved much, especially for the past week. Better energy. He has not started Lupron. HE has Erleada at home but has not started. He is interested in Pluvicto therapy. I have explained that this is typically considered once patients progress on other lines of therapy. He states he plan to go to [REDACTED] in about 2 weeks to be considered for Pluvicto. He has also been seen Nuclear Medicine Oncologist in [REDACTED] Dr. [REDACTED], per patient, he has recommended Lupron, Erleada, and Pluvicto together. Will try and obtain records from Dr. Amigale. His last PSA is from [REDACTED] and its 22.200. CBC and CMP are stable from recently. His Invitae resulted BAP1 variant of uncertain significance. He has not had the dexa scan done.<br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Pt presents for follow up visit. He recently had one treatment of PLUVICTO on [REDACTED] in [REDACTED]. [REDACTED], he will be scheduled for a second treatment. He would prefer another PET PSMA scheduled for this treatment. His documents demonstrates pt is castration-resistant but pt is castration-sensitive. Informed pt he is still sensitive to the Apalutamide and Lupron. He is still compliant with the Apalutamide. Discussed with pt that both drugs concurrently may not be safe. Suggested discontinuing Apalutamide due to unknown interactions. DEXA Bone density finds osteoporosis. Recommend Prolia injection Q6 months after pt obtains dental clearance. <br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Pt presents for follow up visit. He reports his hgb has been low therefore he has been taking iron supplements. It was at 12.2. reported on last labs. He went to [REDACTED] to have PLUVICTO treatment and did not take Apalutamide at that time. However, when he came back, he did not have a prescription for Apalutamide and wasn't able to get any. Recommend going back on Apalutamide since he is no longer on PLUVICTO right now. His PSA is &lt;0.1 from [REDACTED].  He reports hot flashes, will prescribe Effexor. He completed C2 Lupron injections on [REDACTED]. His WBC is low at 2.8, unclear etiology. <br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Patient here for follow up visit. Had right eye surgery to help with his tissue and blinking of his eye. He feels well. He is back on Apalutamide 240mg 4 tablets per day since [REDACTED]. Last Lupron injection was [REDACTED]. He complaints of fatigue, severe hot flashes, and loss of muscle mass. He would like to come off apalutamide and continue to monitor his PSA. He took Effexor for 10 days and did not help. He does not recall needing to get dental clearance letter for prolia. He would like information on the medication and clearance letter. He is taking calcium and vitamin D. We have discussed his labs. PSA undetectable. CBC and CMP are stable. <br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Patient here for follow up visit. Was on Erleada 180mg 3 tabs from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], Then Erleada 120mg from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] and then he has been off medication since [REDACTED]. This is due to fatigue and severe hot flashes. Effexor did not help. He is still on Gabapentin 300mg TID. He would like to continue off Erleada and he is not open to try any other oral medications at this time. We have discussed his latest labs. His PSA has continued to decrease and currently is 0.053. WBC 2.4. ANC is normal at 1.4.<br/><br/>[REDACTED]: Patient here for follow up visit. Last Erleada 180mg 3 tabs on [REDACTED]. Last Lupron on [REDACTED]. He complaints of fatigue which he believes is due to poor appetite and low testosterone. We have discussed marinol for decreased appetite and he agrees.

See note.<br/><br/>Note: Small, polarizable refractile dust particles are present.<br/><br/>===Electronically Signed Out===      <br/><br/>[REDACTED], MD, PhD <br/><br/>Imaging: <br/><br/>[REDACTED] NM PET/CT Skull Base to Thigh<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>*  Right preauricular soft tissue thickening with focal intense FDG uptake. Findings are more concerning for tumor, however infection cannot be entirely excluded. Tissue sampling recommended.<br/>*  Hilar and mediastinal FDG avid lymphadenopathy. Given the presence of calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, this could represent an acute flare of an underlying infectious/inflammatory process. However, in view of the periauricular findings metastasis is<br/> not excluded.<br/>*  Right level 1B FDG avid lymphadenopathy.<br/>*  Additional findings detailed in the body of the report<br/><br/>[REDACTED] CT AP WWO<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>Multiple sclerotic bone lesions, many are either new or much more conspicuous as described above. Differential considerations include treated (previously sub-radiographic) osseous metastatic disease versus new osseous metastatic disease.<br/>No lymphoadenopathy.<br/><br/>[REDACTED] NUCLEAR MEDICINE BONE SCAN<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>Multiple bone metastases. <br/><br/>[REDACTED] CT Chest W<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>1.  No evidence of pulmonary consolidation, masses or pleural effusion.<br/>2.  Mildly enlarged right hilar lymph node, likely corresponding to the site of abnormal FDG accumulation. Additional scattered subcentimeter calcified and noncalcified multistation mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Findings are nonspecific and may be <br/>related to granulomatous infection. Can not exclude metastatic lymphadenopathy.<br/>3.  Few subcentimeter calcified and noncalcified pulmonary nodules. Chest CT follow-up is recommended according to oncologic protocol.<br/><br/>[REDACTED] PET/CT PSMA Skull to Mid-thigh<br/>FINDINGS:<br/>Ga-68 gozetotide PET: Physiologic distribution of tracer is seen in the salivary and lacrimal glands, blood pool, liver, spleen, pancreas, ganglia, bone marrow, bowel, kidneys and urinary tract.<br/><br/>PROSTATE: Nonspecific mildly heterogeneous tracer activity within the residual prostate gland.<br/><br/>LYMPH NODES: Multiple small tracer avid nodal foci are identified, suspicious for multiple foci of nodal metastatic prostate cancer. <br/><br/>For example:<br/>Left posterior mediastinum SUV max 5.9, 3mm, image #137<br/>Posterior mediastinum, SUV max 5.7, 3 mm, image #133<br/>Left para-aortic region, SUV max 6.8, 4 mm, image #196<br/>Aortocaval region, SUV max 8.1, 5 mm, image #194<br/>Left paratracheal region, SUV max 3.1, 2 mm, image #106<br/><br/>SKELETON: Multiple tracer avid skeletal foci strongly favor osseous metastatic disease<br/><br/>For example:<br/>Right body of clavicle, SUV max 7.4, 8 mm, image #125<br/>Scattered tiny lesions within multiple ribs.<br/>Medial left iliac wing, SUV max 1.9, 5 mm, image #233<br/>Left iliac wing, SUV max 11.1, 1.8 x 1.7 cm, image #246<br/>Left intertrochanteric femur, SUV max 7.6, 0.6 x 0.6 cm, image #281<br/><br/>OTHER: Extensive postsurgical changes right neck likely indicating right neck dissection, right parotidectomy and additional surgery likely related to the history above. Comment: FDG PET/CT does not reliably restage melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma.<br/><br/>Scattered tiny low density foci in the liver suggest cysts but are incompletely evaluated on PSMA PET/CT. Given the additional history of multiple neoplasms, further management should be based on upon clinical grounds. <br/><br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>Findings strongly favor extensive nodal and skeletal tracer avid metastatic disease as described above. These findings likely represent metastatic prostate cancer.<br/><br/>[REDACTED] XR Chest AP<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>There is a normal cardiomediastinal contour.<br/>The lungs are well expanded without edema or airspace disease or mass lesion. Subcentimeter left lower lobe calcified granuloma reidentified.<br/>No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.<br/>No definite acute bone process identified. Reidentified nonspecific sclerotic focus within the right clavicular midshaft. Apparent lucent focus within the right posterior sixth rib appears to be artifactual, without correlate on the prior study, and appears related to superimposed bone and vessels.<br/><br/>[REDACTED] CT AP W/<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>1.  Acute uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.<br/>2.  Slightly thickened appearance of the rectum with submucosal hemorrhoids noted.<br/>3.  Reidentified slightly thickened bladder.<br/>4.  Stable focal infrarenal aortic ectasia measuring 2.8 cm.<br/>5.  Please review full report above for additional details and findings.<br/><br/>[REDACTED] DEXA Bone Density Spine and Hip<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>The patient has osteoporosis according to the lowest T-score above.<br/> <br/>FRAX 10-year probability of fracture based on left femoral neck BMD and patient reported risk factors is: 7.2% major osteoporotic fracture and 2.4% hip fracture.<br/> <br/>[REDACTED] NM PET/CT Skull Base to thigh<br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>1.  Extensive postsurgical and posttreatment changes in the right neck without abnormal FDG uptake to suggest tumor recurrence.<br/>2.  No suspicious FDG avid cervical lymphadenopathy.<br/>3.  Multiple scattered sclerotic lesions throughout the osseous structures some of which have increased in size compared to the prior PET/CT on [REDACTED]. These lesions were noted to display increased uptake on outside PSMA PET/CT on [REDACTED] likely consistent with prostate cancer metastasis.<br/>4.
