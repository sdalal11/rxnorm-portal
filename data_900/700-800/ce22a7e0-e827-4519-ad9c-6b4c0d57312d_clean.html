She was last seen in clinic [REDACTED]. As you may know she is a [REDACTED] woman with a history notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, prediabetes, obesity status post gastric bypass surgery (2009) and hyperthyroidism. She was initially referred to us back in [REDACTED] by her PCP [REDACTED] for a positive nuclear stress test in the setting of atypical chest pain. [REDACTED] reported at that time that for the prior month she had experienced chest pressure that she described as heaviness mid substernally that did not radiate. She reported at times it would last for minutes to hours but also experienced an episode lasting 3 days. She denied any associated symptoms including nausea, diaphoresis, dyspnea on exertion or at rest. The chest discomfort was not exertional. From a functional capacity standpoint she had not noted any decrease in her exercise tolerance with the onset of these episodes of chest pain noting that she was able to walk indefinitely on a flat surface and being able to climb at least 4 flights without pause. In regards to her cardiac risk factors, she denied a personal history of MI, strokes or TIA. She has no family history of premature coronary artery disease, stroke or TIAs. She is also a never smoker with no illicit drug use.<br/><br/>With regards to her cardiac history, she has been diagnosed with diastolic heart failure since [REDACTED] for which she has been maintained on daily furosemide, nifedipine, metoprolol by her PCP. Her last echocardiogram in [REDACTED] demonstrated mild concentric LV thickness, LVEF 60%, normal right ventricular size and function, with no significant valvulopathy. In [REDACTED], she underwent a exercise nuclear stress test for which she was able to exercise for 7:26 minutes, achieving 10.1 METS, 108% maximum predicted heart rate with no ischemic symptoms. Her ECG demonstrated borderline ST depressions. Perfusion imaging demonstrated a mild, large anterior and lateral wall ischemia while could be considered due to breast attenuation was deemed to be a high quality study with no evidence of such. Her gated LVEF was calculated as &gt;75%. CTA coronary with calcium score was done to help us characterize further the significance of the stress test findings as well as to further corroborate evidence of coronary artery disease. There was a focal area of calcification in the mid to distal LAD without flow-limiting stenosis; coronary calcium score of 1.4. <br/><br/>She was admitted to TMC in [REDACTED] when she presented with atypical chest pain in the setting of significant home stressors, found to have a severe AKI, uncontrolled blood pressures, and nephrotic range proteinuria. ECG was unremarkable and troponins were negative. Outpatient stress test was done in August and showed a medium sized, mildly severe, reversible defect in the anterior wall. The patient exercised on the treadmill for 6 minutes and time seconds on a [REDACTED] protocol achieving an estimate work load of 7.4 METs. The baseline heart rate was 59 BPM with maximum heart rate of 139 BPM at peak exercise, achieving 92% of the maximum predicted heart rate. The blood pressure 164/90mm Hg at rest and increased to 205/92 mm Hg at peak stress. The resting ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm, poor R wave progression. The ECG during stress demonstrated less than 2 mm ST segment depressions in the inferolateral leads. The patient had symptoms of fatigue during exercise. Exercise was terminated because of fatigue. <br/><br/>She returns [REDACTED] for follow up. She reports indigestion/cramping in her chest at times which is unrelated to exertion. She says this occurs frequently over the last several months, worse when she is stressed. She stays active by gardening and does not experience chest pain when she gardens. She has sublingual nitroglycerin at home which she takes when the "pain feels heavier." She states this resolves her pain. She has noticed more recently that she has been having headaches, unrelated to nitroglycerin. She takes the SLN very infrequently- less than once per month. She is feeling more fatigued over the last several years. She denies any orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, lightheadedness, palpitations, or syncope.<br/><br/>Past Medical History: <br/>Diagnosis Date <br/>• CHF (congestive heart failure) (CMS/HCC)  <br/>• High cholesterol  <br/>• Hypertension  <br/>• Multinodular thyroid [REDACTED] <br/>• Obesity [REDACTED] <br/>• Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [REDACTED] <br/><br/>Past Surgical History: <br/>Procedure Laterality Date <br/>• ABDOMINAL SURGERY   <br/> gastric bypass <br/>• COLONOSCOPY   <br/>• DENTAL SURGERY   <br/>• MYOMECTOMY   <br/>• TUBAL LIGATION   <br/><br/>Family History <br/>Problem Relation Name Age of Onset <br/>• Prostate cancer Father   <br/>• Bone cancer Father   <br/>• Diabetes Sister   <br/>• Cancer Sister   <br/>• Cancer Sister   <br/>• Breast cancer Sister  [REDACTED] <br/>• Diabetes Brother   <br/>• Diabetes Brother   <br/>• Prostate cancer Brother   <br/>• Prostate cancer Brother   <br/><br/>Social History <br/><br/>Tobacco Use <br/>• Smoking status: Never <br/>• Smokeless tobacco: Never <br/>Vaping Use <br/>• Vaping Use: Never used <br/>Substance Use Topics <br/>• Alcohol use: Not Currently <br/>• Drug use: Never <br/><br/>Physical Exam:<br/>Vitals: <br/> [REDACTED] 1319 <br/>BP: (!) 163/77 <br/>BP Location: Right arm <br/>Patient Position: Sitting <br/>Pulse: 68 <br/>Resp: 16 <br/>Weight: 85.9 kg (189 lb 6.4 oz) <br/><br/>Body mass index is 30.57 kg/m².<br/><br/>Gen: AOX3, not in distress<br/>CV: S1 S2, no murmurs rubs or gallops, JVP not elevated <br/>Pulm: CTAB, no wheeze or crackles <br/>Abd: Soft ND NT <br/>Ext: 1+ LE edema bilaterally, warm on exam <br/><br/>Review of systems <br/>Negative except for HPI<br/><br/>Labs <br/>Lab Results <br/>Component Value Date <br/> WBC 6.9 [REDACTED] <br/> HGB 11.7 [REDACTED] <br/> HCT 36.6 [REDACTED] <br/> MCV 86.3 [REDACTED] <br/> PLT 353 [REDACTED] <br/><br/>Lab Results <br/>Component Value Date <br/> GLUCOSE 86 [REDACTED] <br/> CALCIUM 9.6 [REDACTED] <br/> NA 141 [REDACTED] <br/> K 4.7 [REDACTED] <br/> CO2 33 (H) [REDACTED] <br/> CL 101 [REDACTED] <br/> BUN 10 [REDACTED] <br/> CREATININE 0.86 [REDACTED] <br/><br/>Lab Results <br/>Component Value Date <br/> CHOL 251 (H) [REDACTED] <br/><br/>Lab Results <br/>Component Value Date <br/> HDL 82 [REDACTED] <br/><br/>Lab Results <br/>Component Value Date <br/> LDLCALC 147 (H) [REDACTED] <br/><br/>Lab Results <br/>Component Value Date <br/> TRIG 109 [REDACTED] <br/><br/>No results found for: CHOLHDL<br/><br/>Cardiac data<br/>TTE [REDACTED] demonstrated mild concentric LV thickness, LVEF 60%, normal right ventricular size and function, with no significant valvulopathy. <br/><br/>Stress Tests: <br/>Stress Test [REDACTED]<br/>1.

Non-cardiac chest pain with nonobstructive coronary disease <br/>Initial nuclear stress was done in [REDACTED] and was equivocal so coronary CT was done in [REDACTED] which showed plaque in LAD with no flow limiting stenosis. Since then, she had a recent nuclear stress test in August which showed a medium sized, mildly severe, reversible defect in the anterior wall. She denies any exertional angina or dyspnea. The discomfort she describes is non-cardiac in nature. We discussed with her [REDACTED] that prevention of plaque progression with aggressive medical and lifestyle management. She is already on daily aspirin as well as high-dose atorvastatin. Her most recent LDL was 147 in [REDACTED]. We will switch her to pravastatin 40mg daily and also add Zetia 10mg [REDACTED] in order to hopefully achieve an LDL target of less than 70. We will plan to check her lipid panel again [REDACTED]. With her heart rate at 68 bpm [REDACTED], her metoprolol succinate dose of 25 mg daily is already at goal.<br/><br/>2. Hypertension: <br/>Her blood pressures [REDACTED] are not at goal. She is currently maintained on amlodipine 5 mg daily and metoprolol as above. She was previously on losartan but this was discontinued. I recommended we either re-start losartan or trial lisinopril 10mg daily [REDACTED]. I suspect some of her leg edema could be related to [REDACTED] so wanted to trial her off of this. However, she does not want to make too many medication changes [REDACTED] and wants to consider her options over the next couple of months. I advised her to use compression stockings and leg elevation for her leg edema. I also advised her to start a blood pressure log at home and communicate her blood pressures with me. At her next visit, if her BP remains elevated, she will hopefully be agreeable to either re-starting losartan or lisinopril. <br/><br/>3. Hyperlipidemia: <br/>Last known LDL 147 as above. Change atorvastatin to pravastatin 40mg to see if she gets more benefit from this. We will add zetia as well. Both of these subscriptions were sent to her pharmacy. <br/><br/>4. HFpEF <br/>Last echocardiogram with LVEF 60%. She does have lower extremity edema but otherwise appears near euvolemic. She has no HF symptoms. I suspect her leg edema is more related to either amlodipine or venous insufficiency. I recommended leg elevation and compression stocking as above. She will continue her chronic dose of Lasix daily. She is otherwise maintained on beta-blocker as detailed above. <br/><br/>It was a pleasure to see [REDACTED] in clinic [REDACTED]. She was seen by and discussed with [REDACTED].
