DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), nuclear grade 2, solid type. pT1cN1a--h/o left breast cancer.BRCA 2 positive<br/><br/>1. S/p lumpectomy on [REDACTED] INVASIVE MAMMARY CARCINOMA, with mixed ductal and lobular features, Nottingham grade 1 (3+1+1=5), measures 11 mm.

The Oncotype Dx analysis showed a recurrence score of 20, a 17% risk of distant recurrence at 9 years with AI or tamoxifen use<br/><br/>3. Radiation to right breast [REDACTED]-[REDACTED]<br/><br/>3. She continues on Letrozole and [REDACTED] <br/><br/>HPI<br/><br/>[REDACTED] was initially diagnosed in [REDACTED] with left breast cancer. She is s/p left breast mastectomy in [REDACTED] with Dr. [REDACTED] and left breast reconstruction in [REDACTED]. No additional treatment.<br/><br/>She had a recurrence in the left breast in the fall of 1991.She underwent a Left lumpectomy from reconstructed breast in fall 1991 and completed radiation therapy in  [REDACTED].She initiated endocrine therapy with Tamoxifen and completed 15 years in [REDACTED]. This was her last follow up with oncology. <br/><br/>She goes for annual mammograms and underwent an annual mammogram on [REDACTED]. Imaging was ordered. <br/><br/>Mammogram [REDACTED] AKUMIN <br/>IMPRESSION: 7 mm noncalcifled focal asymmetry in the right upper outer quadrant posterior 3rd. BI-RADS a Incomplete- need additional imaging evaluation. Recommendation: Spot compression CC and MLO views of the right breast. Right breast ultrasound. Disclaimer: Dense breasts will decrease sensitivity and may obscure small masses, and may be an independent risk factor for breast cancer. In these patients additional screening with breast ultrasound or breast MRI may be of value 10- 15% of cancers are not identified by mammography or other imaging modalities. Negative mammogram or other imaOng report should not preclude further evaluation could include biopsy of a palpable concern. <br/><br/>Right US Breast and mammogram [REDACTED]<br/>FINDINGS: Mammogram findings: Breast density. Scattered fibroglandular densities Spot-compression views demonstrate a spiculated mass. Ultrasound findings: Right breast 9:00, 5 cm from the nipple, 5 x 5 x 7 mm irregularly-marginated, hypoechoic, shadowing, corresponds to above mammographIc finding, suspicious. <br/><br/>IMPRESSION: Subcentimeter spiculated mass suspicious for malignancy B1-RADS: 5, highly suggestive of malignancy. Recommendation: Ultrasound-guided biopsy. <br/><br/>She had a right breast biopsy at The Women's Diagnostic Center [REDACTED] on [REDACTED]. The pathology revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with lobular features, well differentiated Nottingham grade 1 (3+1+1=5)measuring 0.8cm in greatest linear microscopic dimension, ER &gt;50% , PR&gt;50%, HER2neu 2+ and FISH.

Chemotherapy was not recommended and that she proceed with lumpectomy. <br/><br/>UM Second Opinion<br/>SUBMITTED STUDIES: Outside imaging performed at [REDACTED]. Biopsy performed at the Women's Diagnostic Center Broward Health [REDACTED]<br/>Bilateral mammogram dated [REDACTED], right breast mammogram dated [REDACTED], breast ultrasound dated [REDACTED].<br/> <br/>DIGITAL SCREENING BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM AND RIGHT BREAST DIAGNOSTIC MAMMOGRAM<br/>Technique: Digital bilateral CC and MLO views with and without implant displacement were submitted for review. Subsequent right ML and tomo spot compression views of the right breast were also obtained.<br/> <br/>Findings: The patient is status post left mastectomy. A left retropectoral silicone implant is present.<br/> <br/>The right breast is composed of scattered fibroglandular densities. There is a 1.1 cm irregular equal density spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast at middle depth, corresponding to the site of biopsy-proven malignancy. There is<br/> a persistent right retroareolar asymmetry, best visualized on the CC field and spot compression views, possibly ductal ectasia. There is a mammographically prominent right axillary lymph node. There are benign right breast calcifications, including <br/>coarse and vascular calcifications.<br/> <br/>RIGHT BREAST ULTRASOUND: <br/>Technique: Static ultrasound images of the right breast(s) were submitted for review.<br/> <br/>Findings: There is a 0.7 x 0.9 x 0.6 cm irregular hypoechoic mass with indistinct margins with an echogenic halo and posterior acoustic shadowing in the right breast at 9:00 5 cm from the nipple. No abnormal lymph nodes are demonstrated in the right <br/>axilla.<br/> <br/>Subsequent ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy was performed on [REDACTED] demonstrating accurate targeting of the lesion. Post procedure mammogram demonstrates an O shaped biopsy marker at the biopsy bed.<br/> <br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>1. Biopsy-proven carcinoma in the right breast at 9:00 with appropriately placed biopsy marker. If breast conservation is desired, presurgical mammographic guided needle/wire localization is offered.<br/>2. Persistent right retroareolar asymmetry favoring ductal ectasia. Targeted right breast ultrasound is recommended. At that time repeat targeted ultrasound of the right axilla can be performed given the mammographically prominent right axillary lymph node.<br/><br/>She initially met with [REDACTED] on [REDACTED]. <br/><br/>US right breast [REDACTED]<br/>FINDINGS:  <br/>There is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm round hypoechoic mass with partially indistinct and angular margins in the right breast at 12-3:00, retroareolar corresponding to the mammographic area of asymmetry. There is an adjacent area of shadowing from calcifications<br/> which corresponds to benign dystrophic calcifications on mammogram.<br/>Borderline right axillary lymph node with preserved central fatty hilum and thickened cortex measuring up to 0.4 cm.<br/> <br/>IMPRESSION:<br/>1. A 0.3 cm mass in the right breast at 12-3:00 retroareolar corresponding to mammographic area of asymmetry. Further evaluation with ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted core biopsy is recommended.<br/>2. Borderline right axillary lymph node, given the recent diagnosed right breast invasive ductal carcinoma, further evaluation with ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is recommended.<br/>Findings and recommendations were discussed with the patient at time of exam.<br/> <br/>FINAL ASSESSMENT: BI-RADS 4: Suspicious.
