This was initially diagnosed as tardive dyskinesia. His initial movements included movements of the feet, and then he developed oromandibular movements. He thinks he was tried on a medication initially but cannot recall its name. It helped for a while and then he maxed out the dose and it lost effectiveness. He then switched to austedo which has helped a bit in his opinion, 12mg/18mg. <br/><br/>He has depression. He is unaware of a family history of similar symptoms. He has been on ropinirole for restless leg syndrome but was advised to stop this very recently. Denies cognitive difficulties, mood is well controlled, sleep is good. He feels like he maintains his household OK. He lives with his sister and brother-in-law. He is retired from the military. An MRI of the brain was done recently. <br/><br/>He was diagnosed with RLS between 5 or [REDACTED]. The ropinirole was not helping. He does have an urge to move his feet and legs that is satisfied by moving them, but he does also have involuntary movements in the legs. He is driving currently. But only locally. <br/><br/>He reports a history of visual hallucinations, eg cats. These are well-controlled currently. He cannot recall when they began, but does not think that they started more than [REDACTED]. <br/><br/>Outside VA notes document that he was on risperidone from [REDACTED]-[REDACTED]. Notes describe that the first medication tried was valbenazine and this was then switched to deutetrabenazine. The note also documents a history of HTN, HLD, OSA, hypothyroidism, and prior alcohol use disorder now, now abstained for several years. <br/><br/>His mother was institutionalized during probably early adulthood for "mental illness"; he was about [REDACTED] at this time. He does not recall much about her prior to [REDACTED] yrs of age, and then he met her once at age [REDACTED], and she seemed calm and pleasant. He does not recall involuntary movements. He thinks she passed away in [REDACTED], not sure how old. At least in her late [REDACTED]. <br/><br/>He has no children. He has a brother and a sister who do not have neurological symptoms. <br/><br/>He is prescribed the following psychotropics:<br/>Ziprasidone 40mg BID<br/>Duloxetine 40mg BID<br/>Bupropion 150mg BID<br/>Topiramate 100mg BID (which he says is for tingling in the feet, denies hx seizures or migraines)<br/><br/>Prior or current use of dopamine receptor blockers? Yes; ziprasidone currently. Others previously. Recalls risperidone, aripiprazole. He has been treated for depression for decades, but doesn't recall much of the earlier medication history. <br/><br/>Review of Systems: All organ systems were reviewed with the positives mentioned above, as per the HPI.

He has developed slight more generalized choreiform movements, slight dystonia, bradykinesia,and gait impairment. Saccades are slightly delayed. While much of his exam can be consistent with consequences of neuroleptic use, there are other subtle exam findings and nonspecific family history elements that certainly raise a reasonable question of other causes, chiefly Huntington disease. His MRI does not demonstrate clear  caudate atrophy in my opinion. We discussed these considerations and we will plan for formal genetic counseling in our center for HD testing. <br/> <br/>More than half of this 61 minute visit was spent on counseling and coordination of care related to differential diagnosis, diagnostic testing, risks and benefits of management options, and prognosis in addition to clinical record review and documentation. <br/><br/>[REDACTED], MD<br/><br/></content><br/><span class="xLabel">Electronically signed by [REDACTED], MD at [REDACTED]  4:20 PM EDT</span><br/></content></li></ul>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id6" href="#toc">Plan of Treatment</a></h3><div><p>Not on file</p>documented as of this encounter</div><h3><a name="id7" href="#toc">Visit Diagnoses</a></h3><div><table><colgroup><col width="100%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Diagnosis</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr ID="vdx4" class="xRowNormal"><td><p><span class="content_span">Chorea</span><span class="content_span"> - Primary</span></p><p>Other choreas</p></td></tr><tr ID="vdx5" class="xRowAlt"><td><p><span class="content_span">Parkinsonism, unspecified Parkinsonism type (HC CODE)</span></p></td></tr><tr ID="vdx6" class="xRowNormal"><td><p><span class="content_span">Dystonia</span></p><p>Abnormal involuntary movements</p></td></tr></tbody></table>documented in this encounter</div><h3><a name="id8" href="#toc">Care Teams</a></h3><div><table ID="ct43"><colgroup><col width="25%" span="3"/><col width="13%"/><col width="12%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Team Member</th><th>Relationship</th><th>Specialty</th><th>Start Date</th><th>End Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="xRowNormal"><td><p>Group, MacDill Ophthalmology 6th Medical</p><p>[REDACTED][REDACTED]</p><p>[REDACTED]-5551</p><p>[REDACTED] (Work)</p><p>[REDACTED] (Fax)</p></td><td>PCP - General</td><td/><td>[REDACTED]</td><td/></tr></tbody></table>documented as of this encounter</div><br/><br/>
